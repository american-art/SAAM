Two years later he became an assistant professor at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in Halifax, where he continued teaching until 1978. In the 1980s Fischl's large figurative paintings, aggressive in their confrontation with the viewer, began to receive substantial attention. Along with painting, he turned to photography and monotypes. His 1990 series of Beach paintings drew on photographic sources. Since the late 1970s, Fischl's work has been widely shown in solo and group exhibitions in the United States and Canada. Solo shows of his paintings were presented at the Dalhousie Art Gallery in Halifax, Galerie B in Montreal, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and Mary Boone Gallery in New York. In 1991 Fischl exhibited his monotypes at the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College.http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artist/?id=6575",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I7jTsTC5HnE/default.jpg,,,,KIj_pDwdBbQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIj_pDwdBbQ,,,2015-01-06T14:23:29.000Z,The Art of Memory and Mourning (2 of 2),"This symposium program presents recent scholarship that addresses the subjects of mourning, loss, remembrance, and memorialization as they have manifest in a variety of art forms in the United States over the past three centuries.

The term ""zugunruhe"" describes the nighttime restlessness that all birds exhibit before migration. But here their movement is arrested. The passenger pigeon is frozen in time like a specimen preserved in amber.

A popular culture hit, the design appeared, without Indiana's permission, on a wide range of commercial products. His attempt to reclaim the image from a clichÌ© by remaking it in multiple editions of prints and sculptures alienated critics.

Lacayo has interviewed and profiled numerous artists and architects, including David Hockney, Damien Hirst, Martin Puryear, Richard Serra, and Frank Gehry. In his talk, Lacayo will confront the widespread perception of the artist flourishing and dying early-e.g., Caravaggio, Modigliani, Raphael, Van Gogh-when more commonly, the major figures of art history lived into ripe old age. Artists including Matisse, Michelangelo, Monet, O'Keeffe, Picasso, and Renoir worked into their 80s or 90s.

A closed-circuit TV camera is directed at the sky. Custom electronics read the moving image like a sheet of music, transforming the movement of clouds and changing light into a living composition of musical notes. The resulting electronic score fills the space with subtly shifting harmonics, transporting the natural environment into the gallery for an immersive audio-visual experience. At once a playful and conceptual homage to chance, Cloud Music enables us to ""listen"" to video as a nature-driven event unfolding in real time, creating a new way to experience the world.http://www.americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=86231",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G11HtxvXyLA/default.jpg,,,,foj7KXInbFU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foj7KXInbFU,2486,,2013-08-07T13:51:05.000Z,Art Signs - CafÌ©,"""CafÌ©"" by William H.

When scholars have looked eastward, they often have considered the Asian influence on art of the United States as a unidirectional and limited development, suggesting that Asian culture was monolithic and unchanging while characterizing American artists as dynamic and original in their ability to absorb and meld the best of diverse global outlooks. For more information, visit the website: http://www.americanart.si.edu/research/symposia/2009/",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BBpyNr5m0oY/default.jpg,,,,cc6sxZdOAuk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cc6sxZdOAuk,3670,2012_paik,2013-04-30T14:38:29.000Z,East-West Interchanges in American Art: Partha Mitter,"Partha Mitter, emeritus professor of art history, University of Sussex""India and America: Mutual Perceptions in the Contact Zone""""A Long and Tumultuous Relationship""East-West Interchanges in American ArtOctober 1--2, 2009This two-day symposium at the Smithsonian American Art Museum explored the complicated interactions between American and Asian artists and visual traditions from the eighteenth century to the present.

He briefly studied engineering at the University of Florida before enrolling in the architecture program at the Cooper Union Art School. During his first year at Cooper Union, King was impressed by the steel sculptures of David Smith and promised to make a similar piece for an attractive female classmate. He began selling works to friends and fellow students and committed himself to a career in sculpture. King constructs his pieces from a variety of materials, ranging from burlap to wood to aluminum. He draws inspiration from daily life, and his tall, elongated figures imitate everyday human gestures, poking fun at human behavior.http://www.americanart.si.edu/luce/artist.cfm?key=344&artistmedia=690&object=165385&subkey=2635",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UX0cLiPOCoE/default.jpg,,,,IPCq8r52B4Y,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPCq8r52B4Y,6244,,2012-12-04T15:01:42.000Z,Meet Miriam Schapiro,"An interview with the artist Miriam SchapiroMiriam Schapiro earned her master of fine arts degree at the University of Iowa in 1949 and in 1952 moved to New York City with her husband, the artist Paul Brach. In Manhattan, Schapiro discovered that women artists were not taken seriously by the male-dominated abstract expressionist movement. Schapiro's abstract paintings of the 1950s won her some recognition by museums and galleries, but she struggled for decades with her identities as a wife, mother, and professional painter. In the 1970s she collaborated with the artist Judy Chicago on Womanhouse, the mansion famously transformed by a women's art cooperative into a gigantic installation of feminist art. Schapiro's ""femmages,"" her assemblages of scraps of fabric, buttons, lace, and other ""feminine"" tokens, appear in major American museums.

She was the first person in her family to finish high school, and went on to enroll in religious studies and art at San Diego State University. She started as a painter, but became interested in fiber art while in college and soon turned all of her attention to weaving and textile design. Underwood imbues her pieces with powerful messages about her Chicana heritage, creating images that call attention to the dangers that Mexicans face trying to cross the border into the United States in search of a better life.http://www.americanart.si.edu/luce/artist.cfm?key=344&artistmedia=471&object=184033&subkey=109555",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j25Z8jzqWo0/default.jpg,,,,zyOE_UmsL6w,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyOE_UmsL6w,6213,,2012-12-04T14:29:24.000Z,Meet Frank Romero,"An interview with the artist Frank RomeroFrank Romero grew up in the Hispanic, Asian, and Jewish communities of East Los Angeles. He began painting when he was five years old and as a teenager attended LA's Otis Art Institute, one of the best art schools in the nation. Romero did not think of himself as a Chicano until he began to work with three other artists in an informal group known as Los Four. Los Four and other Hispanic artists throughout the West used wall murals, graffiti, and street theater to protest America's involvement in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. The police response to antiwar demonstrations in Los Angeles was part of a larger pattern of violence against the minority communities that Romero experienced throughout his life. It takes years for the artist to think through and to paint these episodes in the life of his community, because, he says, ""That stuff is hard for me to do, it hurts, it's frightening"" (Los Angeles Times, July 28, 2002 [online]). Romero's brightly colored paintings celebrate the Los Angeles culture of lowriders and ""rascuache,"" the art of making something beautiful out of the ordinary.http://www.americanart.si.edu/luce/artist.cfm?key=344&artistmedia=481&object=182516&subkey=108716",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zyOE_UmsL6w/default.jpg,,,,oM4GB1dspPI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM4GB1dspPI,1275,,2012-12-05T14:00:03.000Z,Meet Harvey Dinnerstein,"An interview with the artist Harvey DinnersteinHarvey Dinnerstein grew up in a Jewish neighborhood in Brownsville, Brooklyn. He studied art in New York and Philadelphia, and was an instructor at the Art Students League for many years. Dinnerstein started his career just as abstract expressionism was beginning to take hold in America. He rejected this new style, however, and focused on emphasizing the ""traditions of the past"" in his realistic, detailed images (Harvey Dinnerstein, A Retrospective Exhibition, The Butler Institute of American Art, 1994). Dinnerstein paints from life, and many of his images show intimate, poignant views of the people and buildings of New York and Brooklyn, where he has lived for most of his life.

After only thirty minutes, he recalls, ""The stone took me over. It was so hard it barely showed what I had done to it . . . It controlled me. I fell in love with it."" He began sculpting exclusively in granite, using a diamond-edged electrical saw capable of ""tearing"" the stone. Moroles went on to establish one of the largest stone-carving workshops in the country, which he runs with the help of his father, brother, and sister. In 2001, Moroles began to strike his sculptures, sometimes with batons, sometimes with his hands or his feet, creating a type of music one audience member called ""an unearthly composition . . . that recalled the effect of the . . .

She painted a goatee on her face with axle grease and borrowed a neighbor's beret so she could be photographed posing as the famous artist. In 1958, Smith enrolled at Olympic College in Bremerton, Washington. She had to take many breaks from college in order to earn money, however, and didn't earn her degree until 1976. She moved to Albuquerque, where she studied at the University of New Mexico and founded the Grey Canyon group of contemporary Native American artists.

When he was young, he was mixed up in drugs, alcohol, guns, and fast cars and had several run-ins with the police. In 1990, however, he was involved in a serious car accident that changed his life. The accident put him in a coma, during which he saw a muerte (death figure) by his great-uncle JosÌ© InÌ©s Herrera at the end of a tunnel of light. He believes this image brought him out of the coma and that God intended for him to become a saint maker (Awalt and Rhetts, Herrera, Visions of My Heart, with essay by Charles Rosenak, 2003). Saint makers, or santeros, create devotional paintings and carvings of saints for use in churches and in private homes. Herrera makes crucifixes, death figures, and saints as well as sculptures inspired by modern issues such as police brutality and the dangers of nuclear power.http://www.americanart.si.edu/luce/artist.cfm?key=344&artistmedia=463&object=1976&subkey=7405",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EhvmYFR0hY0/default.jpg,,,,WL22CNhA_dQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WL22CNhA_dQ,2341,,2012-12-03T20:32:11.000Z,Meet Robert Hudson,"An interview with the artist Robert HudsonRobert Hudson grew up in rural Washington State and moved to San Francisco to attend college. Hudson was influenced by the city's ceramic artists, whose brightly colored works combine traditional craft and sculpture. He has said that he loves to be ""in a position of being overwhelmed,"" so he makes objects that blur the lines between sculpture, painting, and drawing. His trompe l'oeil, or ""fool the eye,"" sculptures look like one material but are actually made of another, often confusing our perceptions of two- and three-dimensional objects (Beal, ""Welded Irony: The Sculpture of Robert Hudson,"" in Robert Hudson, A Survey, 1985).http://www.americanart.si.edu/luce/artist.cfm?key=344&artistmedia=465&object=181048&subkey=105346",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WL22CNhA_dQ/default.jpg,,,,SjHpTmzGg4o,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjHpTmzGg4o,1811,,2012-12-03T15:37:21.000Z,Meet Sam Gilliam,"An interview with the artist Sam GilliamSam Gilliam grew up in Tupelo, Mississippi, and studied art in Louisville, Kentucky. In 1962 he moved to Washington, D.C., and created abstract paintings inspired by the Washington Color School artists Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland. These artists, among others, broke the rules of abstract expressionism by pouring thinned paint directly onto unprimed canvas instead of applying thick, vigorous brushstrokes. Gilliam pushed this method even further by folding and draping the canvas before it dried, creating unusual ""tie-dye"" effects. He started working with very large canvases in the late 1960s, hanging vast pieces of painted cloth across walls and ceilings to emphasize the relationship between the work and its environment.http://www.americanart.si.edu/luce/artist.cfm?key=344&artistmedia=455&object=161595&subkey=104879",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SjHpTmzGg4o/default.jpg,,,,FcV_Osha5gU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcV_Osha5gU,5718,,2012-12-03T20:21:39.000Z,Meet Yuriko Yamaguchi,"An interview with the artist Yuriko YamaguchiYuriko Yamaguchi was born in Osaka, Japan, after the Second World War. When she moved to the United States at the age of twenty-three, she barely spoke English and turned to art to express herself, exploring her identity as a ""tiny being in a vast universe."" She links elements with wood or wires and hangs her works on walls and ceilings to represent her spiritual connections with the world around her. She uses only delicate materials, such as thin wires, resin, or twigs in order to evoke the simplicity of Japanese poetry.

During cleaning, conservators carefully remove layers of accumulated grime; darkened varnish; and old, discolored retouching from the surface of paintings. To restore areas of lost paint, conservators fill the areas of loss with gesso, and inpaint them to match surrounding areas of original paint.

After his first son was born, Barnet began a series of paintings that show scenes of family life. He experimented with abstraction for several years, aiming to ""eliminate realistic space"" in favor of simple geometric forms. His later work is more representational and focuses almost entirely on the female form.

She worked odd jobs in New York through the 1950s to pay for paint.

These statuettes, sculpted in plaster and painted a sandy color, portray individuals engaged in everyday activities. This particular sculpture is from&nbsp;Rogers's well-known Civil War series, in which a Southern woman and her young son must take the oath in order to receive food rations distributed by the Union Army. <SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'""><EM>Taking the Oath and Drawing Rations</EM></SPAN> illustrates the hardships endured by the masses throughout the Civil War.</FONT></SPAN><?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" /><o:p></o:p>"

In the scene, Antonio has been called to trial against the moneylender Shylock, who is demanding a pound of flesh for nonpayment of a loan. Antonio’s friend Portia is dressed as a judge trying to bargain with Shylock. Upon the suggestion that a surgeon be present when the flesh is extracted, Shylock challenges, “Is it so nominated in the bond?” to which Portia replies, “It is not so express’d; but what of that? ‘Twere good you do so much for charity.”"
1882.1.4                                  ,Luce Center Label,"<p><i>“Ha’ I Like Not That”</i> refers to a scene from Shakespeare’s <i>Othello.</i> Othello and Iago have arrived to greet Othello’s wife, Desdemona, who is speaking with Cassio. Upon seeing Cassio, the traitorous Iago mutters, “Ha! I like not that,” and hints to Othello that Desdemona and Cassio may be having an affair. In this piece the actor Edwin Booth posed for Iago, and Tommaso Salvini may have posed for Othello.</p>"
1882.1.6                                  ,Luce Center Label,"<I>Wounded to the Rear, One More Shot</I> was the most successful of John Rogers’s Civil War groups, which continued to sell long after the war ended. General Joseph R. Hawley, who received a plaster copy in 1868, commented that “nothing relating to the war in painting or sculpture surpasses One Shot More.” It depicts two injured Union soldiers, one of whom is preparing to fire a final shot at the enemy."
1882.1.7                                  ,Luce Center Label,"<I>The Favored Scholar</I> was one of John Rogers’s more sentimental groups, showing a girl receiving special attention from a young male teacher. It proved a very personal subject for one schoolteacher, Mr. B. W. Woodward from Pennsylvania, who gave this sculpture pride of place after he married his own “favored scholar.”"
1882.1.8                                  ,Luce Center Label,"<p>John Rogers created several groups that depicted people playing checkers. The first of these, <i>Checker Players,</i> was modeled in 1859 and received so much publicity that Rogers decided to devote all of his time to sculpting. <i>Checkers up at the Farm</i> was completed some fifteen years later and was Rogers’s second most popular piece, with a total sale of five thousand copies. The artist’s wife, Hattie, was the model for the farmer’s wife who watches the final moments of the game.</p>"
1882.1.9                                  ,Luce Center Label,"<p>John Rogers sold more than eight thousand copies of the group <i>Coming to the Parson,</i> making it by far his most successful piece. This group was particularly favored as a wedding present. Rogers included a newspaper titled <i>The Union,</i> which was inspired by a newspaper he read while working as a mechanic in Manchester, New Hampshire.</p>"
1895.10.1                                 ,Luce Center Label,"<p>Edward Kemeys’ extensive study of animals in the wild gave him a feeling for their characters. His sculptures convey a wildness and individuality that were lost to animals in captivity. Although the beasts in many of his sculptures appear at rest, we often get the sense that more is happening in the wider environment.</p>"
1895.10.2                                 ,Luce Center Label,"<p>Edward Kemeys modeled many sculptures of the black and grizzly bears that he saw on his travels in the American West. He portrayed each animal’s formidable power while also capturing a lighter, more playful side to its character. In this way, Kemeys created a fiction in which wild animals were transformed into approachable, friendly creatures.</p>"

Both pieces vividly portray predators and their victims in the natural world and express the artist’s passion for hunting and adventure.</p>"
1906.9.11                                 ,Gallery Label,"Jack Porter, a veteran of the War of 1812 who made a handsome living from Pennsylvania's coal mines, is surrounded by handmade objects, including a corncob pipe, a roughly-hewn wooden bench, and his wife's knitting. As a self-sufficient landholder and businessman, ""Squire Jack"" embodied an independent and enduring spirit that, by the 1850s, had become an American ideal, celebrated by painters and writers alike. The squire takes his ease on the porch of a substantial home, dressed in a flowered vest, black cravat, and polished boots that signal the rewards of his hard work.<p>Exhibition Label, Smithsonian American Art Museum, 2006"
1906.9.15                                 ,Luce Center Label,"<p>Henry Elliott Johnston (1831-1884) was a Baltimore railroad executive and banker. He and his wife, Harriet, traveled frequently to Europe to build their art collection, and this bust was created on one of their trips to Rome. Like other wealthy Americans of the Gilded Age, the Johnstons hoped that America would one day compete with European art institutions. They anticipated that their private collection would contribute to that process by becoming part of “a national gallery of art.”</p>"
1906.9.16                                 ,Luce Center Label,"<p>In 1872, William Henry Rinehart visited Baltimore, where the Johnston family commissioned him to create four portraits, including marble busts of Henry Elliott Johnston and his wife, Harriet Lane Johnston, and full-length sculptures of their two children posing as Cupid. The statues of Henry Jr., age two, and James, age five, are identical except for the faces, and Rinehart only needed to make clay models of the boys’ heads before returning to his studio in Rome. This allowed him more time to sculpt the boys’ bodies from live models in his studio. Here, the young Henry appears unaware of his surroundings as he concentrates on stringing his bow. This creates a natural, unself-conscious sculpture that contrasts with the sentimental images of Cupid popular in Victorian society.</p>"
1906.9.2                                  ,Luce Center Label,"John Henry Brown chose to paint this miniature from a daguerreotype he made of United States president James Buchanan (1791-1868), and took great satisfaction in the likeness. James Buchanan Henry, the president’s nephew and ward, later wrote a biography of his uncle, commenting that “The best likeness of him is a miniature portrait on ivory, by Brown of Philadelphia . . . Buchanan was tall---over six feet, broad shouldered, and had a portly and dignified bearing . . . his features [were] strong and well marked, [and] his eyes were blue, intelligent and kindly, with the peculiarity that one was far and the other near sighted, which resulted in a slight habitual inclination of the head to one side.”"
1906.9.4                                  ,Luce Center Label,<p>Henry Dexter’s project to create a portrait gallery of the president and all the governors was long and arduous. He undertook extensive travel during a time of war and his working method involved creating multiple copies. The first step was modeling the portrait from life and casting it in plaster. He would later make a copy in marble for public display.</p>
1906.9.5                                  ,Luce Center Label,"<p>James Buchanan served many roles before he was elected the fifteenth president of the United States. This portrait was painted after his term as minister to Russia, but he also acted as a representative, senator, and secretary of state. Jacob Eichholtz's painting accurately depicts Buchanan, who often wore black suits and large white cravats. The future president appears composed and confident, but his slightly uneven eyes give him an intimidating stare. The portrait was owned by Buchanan and then given to his niece, Harriet Lane Johnston, who served as his official hostess at the White House during his administration.</p>"
1906.9.5                                  ,Luce Object Quote,"""He was, on the whole, a distinguished and handsome looking man, and his size and fine proportions gave a dignity and commanding air to his personal presence. His manner and bearing had much of the old-fashioned courtly school about it."" James Buchanan Henry, quoted in <i>The Works of James Buchanan</i>, ed. John Bassett Moore, 1911, p. 330"
1909.10.1                                 ,Luce Center Label,"<p>In 1908, Leon Dabo's <i>Evening on the Hudson</i> won a prize from the National Arts Club. (Pancza, ""Leon Scott Dabo,"" in <i>Artists of Michigan from the Nineteenth Century</i>, 1987). He used little detail, preferring instead to paint with subtle washes of color. In this piece the soft tones of green, purple, and gray evoke the fading light just after sunset, and lights across the water glimmer from a distant town.</p>"
1909.7.20                                 ,Luce Center Label,"Charles Melville Dewey was among the practitioners of American&nbsp;tonalism, a style of painting&nbsp;characterized by muted colors and&nbsp;soft-edged, atmospheric effects.&nbsp;<EM>The Close of Day</EM> captures that fleeting moment as&nbsp;shadows gather&nbsp;and the sun slips beneath&nbsp;the horizon. In&nbsp;the foreground,&nbsp;light reflected in puddles&nbsp;highlights&nbsp;the cart tracks&nbsp;in a dirt road that leads to a house with a smoking chimney, seen&nbsp;in the distance."
1909.7.21                                 ,Luce Center Label,"<p>Thomas Wilmer Dewing’s paintings of elegant women evoked an exclusive world of beauty and refined taste. From 1885 until 1905, Dewing was a key figure in the artist colony at Cornish, New Hampshire, which included Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Abbott Thayer. They agreed that art and beauty offered a “higher life” for an age in which Darwin’s theories challenged Christian beliefs and urban industrialization disrupted life’s natural rhythms. <i>Summer</i> shows women in evening gowns theatrically posed in nature and conveys the “Cornishite’s” attitude that life should be a chain of beautiful moments. Every summer, Dewing orchestrated twilight picnics and participated in theatrical performances with fellow artists and writers in the woods of Cornish. (Pyne, <i>Art and the Higher Life: Painting and Evolutionary Thought in Nineteenth-century America</i>, 1996) </p>"

1909.7.27                                 ,Luce Center Label,"<p>Childe Hassam lived in New York, but he also spent a good deal of time away from the chaos of urban life, painting landscapes and quaint villages in New England. (Pyne, <i>Art and the Higher Life</i>, 1999) In this painting of New Jersey's Navesink Highlands, he used quick brushstrokes to capture the effect of a cool spring breeze in the flickering leaves and ripples on the water. After he had chosen a frame for the piece he wrote to his patron William T. Evans that ""I am glad to say it looks as fine as anything anywhere in the world.""</p>"
1909.7.28                                 ,Gallery Label,"<i>A Visit from the Old Mistress</i> captures a tentative encounter in the postwar South. The freed slaves are no longer obliged to greet their former mistress with welcoming gestures, and one remains seated as she would not have been allowed to do before the war. Winslow Homer composed the work from sketches he had made while traveling through Virginia; it conveys a silent tension between two communities seeking to understand their future. The formal equivalence between the standing figures suggests the balance that the nation hoped to find in the difficult years of Reconstruction.<p>Exhibition Label, Smithsonian American Art Museum, 2006"
1909.7.3                                  ,Luce Center Label,"<p>Ralph Albert Blakelock is most famous for his moonlit landscapes. In <i>Moonrise</i>, we can just make out the glowing orb behind thickly painted auburn trees. The mysterious yellow-green light from the sky gives a hint of shadowy earth in the foreground and a tree trunk to the left, intensifying the sense of being in a place within the artist's mind.</p>"
1909.7.30                                 ,Luce Center Label,"<p>William Henry Howe made a name for himself in France and the United States as a painter of animals. His farm scenes provided patrons with an antidote to the unnerving changes in American society brought about by industrialization. The prize bull and placid cow in these paintings evoke the patriarchal and matriarchal roles of a nineteenth-century household, and hark back to an ideal of agrarian America that seemed distant from the urban bustle of the Gilded Age.</p>"

Sentimental scenes like this of people enjoying nature were popular during the nineteenth century, as towns and industry gradually took over the landscape. In this image, Inness captured the moment just before sunset when everything is bathed in golden light. He painted the figures in the same rich tones as the landscape, underscoring his belief in the harmony between man, nature, and God.</p>"

The clearing through the tall trees in this image invites us to join the group of figures, who are enjoying the shade of the forest. The rich colors and soft shapes evoke the muffled sounds created by a thick carpet of pine needles.</p>"
1909.7.36                                 ,Gallery Label,"William Kendall had three daughters whom he loved to paint in tender moments with their mother, Margaret. Here, the closed curtain and open book suggest a bedtime story, but there is a tantalizing hint of another meaning in this image. Margaret Kendall turns her face away from her husband to focus her affection on her daughter, who looks out at us with a wide-eyed, almost haunted expression. The title suggests a quiet moment before something happens, and it is possible that this image foreshadowed the disintegration of Kendall’s family. When <i>An Interlude</i> was painted, the artist had begun a relationship with the adolescent niece of artist Albert Herter. Kendall eventually divorced Margaret, resigned his teaching position at Yale, and retired to Hot Springs, Virginia, with Christine Herter.<p>Exhibition Label, Smithsonian American Art Museum, 2006"
1909.7.48                                 ,Luce Center Label,"<p>In <i>Great Silas at Night,</i> Robert Minor created a small yet dramatic nighttime image of waves crashing against the rocks. Minor was living in Greenwich Village in 1890, and this may be a view of the New York or Connecticut coastline. A pinpoint of light from a lighthouse is just visible in the distance, emphasizing the scale of the waves and the potential danger that faced ships sailing off the coast.</p>"
1909.7.51                                 ,Luce Center Label,"<p>J. Francis Murphy created intimate landscape scenes that were painstakingly produced. His process required applying one overall wash of paint to the canvas while he was outside so that he could capture the dominant colors of the landscape. He would let the canvas dry for up to a year before completing the painting in his studio. With its spindly trees, soft yellow-green fields and sweeping clouds, <i>Indian Summer</i> conjures the hazy quality of a memory or dream. (Burke, “J. Francis Murphy,” <i>American Paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art</i>, vol. III, 1980)</p>"
1909.7.57                                 ,Luce Center Label,"<p>This painting shows Robert Reid’s young wife, Elizabeth Reeves, in the year of their wedding. Reid painted Elizabeth in a white gown surrounded by many different colored flowers to emphasize her flawless porcelain skin. Their marriage lasted only a few years, and here the delicate colors and idealized setting suggest the optimism of young love. Reid's many paintings of girls immersed in nature emphasize the fragility and beauty of women, as if he equated them with the flowers, trees, and clouds.</p>"

This country scene evokes the Brandywine River valley of Smedley’s youth. The woman’s face glows as she banters with her surprise visitor, who leans into the shadowy room from the sun-drenched field beyond. Smedley’s skill in bringing a story to life shows in this image.

1909.7.65                                 ,Luce Center Label,"<p>Twachtman drew inspiration from his seventeen acres of land in Greenwich, Connecticut, and his paintings of the property express the emotional and spiritual comfort he found there. This image describes the beginning of the seasonal transition from winter to spring. Twachtman depicted bare trees and an icy, swollen brook, but allowed the brown primed canvas to show through his thinly applied paint so that a feeling of warmth and regeneration could emerge. Twachtman created many images of streams and brooks, and these ceaselessly moving bodies of water might have held a deeper significance for him. By the time Twachtman painted his Connecticut landscapes, American artists and intellectuals had been interested in Buddhism for more than two decades, and the artist himself had studied Zen philosophy and Japanese art. (Pyne, ""John Twachtman and the Therapeutic Landscape,"" in Chotner et al., <i>John Twachtman: Connecticut Landscapes</i>, 1989) This may account for the meditative quality of his pictures, the sense of looking not at an actual landscape, but at an inward image of something seen long before.</p>"
1909.7.68                                 ,Luce Center Label,"Douglas Volk’s son, Leo, sits in a lush field at twilight, catching his breath from a day's excitement outdoors. He holds the arrow in a relaxed grip, as a confident young hunter would carry his spear. Leo occupies a transitional time in life, no longer a boy and not yet a man. In the early twentieth century the term ""adolescence"" came into popular use, and psychologists encouraged parents to guide their children through these turbulent years (Mintz, <I>Huck's Raft: A History of American Childhood</I>, 2004). The character of Peter Pan, a boy who did not want to grow up, first appeared in the pages of <I>Scribner’s Magazine</I> the year before this painting was made. In this climate, Volk exhibited the painting at the 1904 St. Louis World’s Fair to great acclaim. He pictured his son as an energetic American boy, but the classical, pastoral setting also conveyed a timeless ideal of youth on the verge of adulthood."
1909.7.7                                  ,Luce Center Label,"In this piece, Robert Blum positioned the viewer as though he were looking down a narrow Venetian canal from a boat on the water. The view shows the Rio Ogni Santi (River of All Saints), in the San Trovaso Quarter, where Blum lived for a time. He spent many summers and winters in Venice, and his sketches, pastels, and paintings capture the city's bright colors and hodgepodge of buildings. In the center of the waterway a man steers a <I>sandolo</I>, which is a smaller, lighter version of a gondola."

She rests lightly on a chair with her eyes cast downward, completely unaware of the viewer. A contemporary critic praised this woman for her ""mixture of sturdiness and charm,"" qualities valued in turn-of-the-century gentlewomen. In the early twentieth century, modernization brought on by steam power and railroads caused feelings of anxiety among many Americans. To help alleviate such feelings, artists created images like these of quiet interior scenes, a visually soothing antidote to an unquiet age.</p>"

He created a few scenes based on sketches he made in France, but most of his work depicted the countryside around his summer home in Connecticut. Carlsen admired French landscape artists who painted outdoors, and he emulated their simple scenes, emphasizing the color and atmosphere of the countryside.</p>"
1909.9.6                                  ,Luce Center Label,"<p><i>Old Church at Giverny</i> was painted in the summer of 1891 and depicts the west elevation and conical tower of the Church of Sainte Radegonde in the French village of Giverny, located fifty miles from Paris on the River Seine. In the late nineteenth century, France was an international center of artistic training and production and was a popular destination for American painters and collectors. Typically, American artists would settle in Paris but also make regular excursions into the French countryside, where they could paint outdoors. Theodore Robinson was among a group of American painters who began to visit Giverny, where the French impressionist painter Claude Monet had settled in 1883. Robinson's friendship with Monet greatly influenced his technique in this period and manifested itself most significantly in the loose brushstrokes that indicate color and light. The paintings made by Robinson at Giverny are notable for the absence of the modernity that was sweeping French cities and towns, and appear to emphasize Giverny as a place where man and nature can still live in harmony.</p>"

In this image the teacher plays a portative organ and her student follows on a flute. Before the ruptures of the First World War, middle-class American families still aspired to a nineteenth-century ideal of gentility. Children, particularly girls, were encouraged to study art and music as part of their upbringing.

Earlier artists had pictured America's mountain peaks and virgin forests, but by midcentury, the railroads, mines, and oil fields were the new and exciting scenes to paint. From a mineshaft that looks like a bleeding wound, tailings stream down the side of the cliff to the water, where ore was loaded onto barges. Nearby were the blast furnaces of the Bay State Iron Mine Company, which supplied the steel for America's railroads. Railways in turn carried more raw materials to the nation's burgeoning factories. Painted during the Civil War, Martin's canvas quietly asserted the primacy of the North, whose strength lay in its natural resources and manufacturing.<p>Exhibition Label, Smithsonian American Art Museum, 2006"

In the colorless murk before dawn, the light of the moon makes a white horse and his rider a target for an unseen enemy. A contemporary reviewer commented that ""you would somehow like them to retreat&#151;or advance&#151;or do something that would bring matters to a head."" By 1907 Remington had made the transition from popular illustrator to respected artist, and this was the first painting of his to be acquired by an American museum. Despite his successes, this was the period in which he painted many canvases that evoked darkness and unidentifiable dangers. The artist often spoke during these years of feeling as though he were under attack. The mythical West had been tamed, and his own culture in the East seemed threatened by waves of European immigrants. He referred to Anglo-Saxon urban Americans like himself as ""his tribe,"" in danger of extinction.<p>Exhibition Label, Smithsonian American Art Museum, 2006"

Or the first week of Octobre at the latest? Please do not say no—Put me in the Barn if you will—but come to Lyme I must sometime this Autumn.""</p> <p>In this painting, Bicknell captured the moment the sun rises to reveal the country landscape. Soft colors and brushstrokes, combined with the cool morning light, give the painting an otherworldly quality. Lush trees climb a small hill on the right side of the canvas. The left side is open, revealing the mountains in the distance. This asymmetrical arrangement shows the influence of Japanese woodblock prints.

But as the United States grew in power and prestige, the workers who provided the nation's muscle also seemed to threaten Hassam's orderly and prosperous world. The artist had won fame and fortune picturing New York for the delight of its moneyed class; the art, music, and fine manners surrounding this ""blond Aryan girl"" provided a buffer against the unruliness of America's immigrant society. If the skyscraper represents worldly ambition, the other vertical elements in the painting&#151;the lilies, the Hellenistic figurine, the panels of a beautiful oriental screen&#151;suggest a different kind of aspiration.

In <i>Dancing Dryads</i>, Ryder added many layers of paint and glaze to create a thick, enamel-like surface that emphasized the glowing colors and dreamlike scene. Over time, however, the colors faded and an early restorer actually added the outlines around the figures to prevent them from disappearing into the background.

In this unfinished painting, we can see where he changed the composition simply by painting his latest idea over previous attempts. He altered the direction of the hay cart and decided it should be pulled by oxen instead of horses. We can still see the faint outline of a horse behind the wheels, while the oxen are just blocked in with a reddish-brown wash.

Ryder chose a Biblical tale of damnation, terror, and salvation that suited his poetic temperament and his manner of working. He was a thoughtful and literate painter who often found himself waiting for inspiration to strike. When the moment came, Ryder gave himself over to the act of painting, stopping only to gather his energy and courage. We imagine his brush sweeping and turning through the thick paint, much as Jonah struggled in the ocean’s pitching waves. American artists a generation later were inspired by Ryder's mythic themes and vigorous painting. His example helped them to create a new art for the American century.

Ryder was inspired by the story of King Cophetua from an Elizabethan ballad that tells of love overcoming all odds. In the tale, a king of Africa falls in love with a beautiful young beggar maid and marries her, despite her lowly status. Ryder was a hopeless romantic and believed wholeheartedly in love at first sight. In this painting he chose the scene when the king first notices the young girl to show that people’s lives could change in just one moment. (Broun, <i>Albert Pinkham Ryder</i>, 1989)</p>"

Recent research, however, suggests that it is probably a copy done in the late nineteenth century. It is unusual for Byzantine artifacts to be replicated in this way, but at the turn of the twentieth century, many Russian museums were publishing their collections for the first time and copies were likely made from the photographs. Religious art flourished during the Byzantine period, and the interiors of churches were lavishly decorated to reflect the grandeur of heaven. As a result, altarpieces, icons, jewelry, and mosaics gleamed with gold, precious stones, and rich colors. Wealthy people in the Byzantine Empire wore jewelry containing icons of sacred figures as symbols of their devotion. This necklace is composed of a series of gold medallions, on which the images of Christ, his twelve apostles, and Constantine’s Cross have been illustrated in glass mosaic and gold paint.</p>"

Barnard’s description of the piece reflects late nineteenth-century attitudes about the “nature” of men and women. The man, who struggles to provide for his family, resists death. The woman, however, through her role as a mother, surrenders to the inevitable as a natural part of the cycle of life.</p>"

To fill these churches, he imported Byzantine icons and furnishings, and Russian artists soon began to copy their rich, ornate forms. This piece was built in three wooden panels, decorated with pearls and precious stones. The intricate topmost layer of gold has been cut away to reveal the paintings on the wood below. The center panel shows the Virgin Mary and Christ, each surrounded by a jewel-encrusted halo. The two side panels depict scenes from the life of Mary and Jesus, edged by a pattern of acanthus leaves. Altarpieces are not used in Orthodox churches, therefore it is likely that this triptych was used for private veneration, in a home, monastic cell or on a wealthy Russian's travels.</p>"

The town of Green River was a rowdy settlement tucked into a valley between sandstone bluffs. It had popped up overnight as the Union Pacific Railroad stretched across the continent. By 1882 the West was largely settled, but banks and laundry houses did not offer a romantic scene, so Moran painted the valley as he imagined it looked when Indians rode there. Such vividly colored western scenes proved to be a bonanza for the Union Pacific's chief rival, the Northern Pacific Railroad. Jay Cooke, the Philadelphia financier who owned the Northern Pacific, kept Moran on retainer for several years, generating nostalgic images that helped to draw thousands of greenhorns out to the farthest stops on his railroad.<p>Exhibition Label, Smithsonian American Art Museum, 2006"

1946.1.1                                  ,Luce Center Label,"<p>This miniature has been identified variously as a portrait of Stephen Fuller Austin, the pioneering Texan, or his brother James Brown Austin. Although the man’s features bear a resemblance to the Austins, there is no evidence that Catlin ever met the Texans, and as of this writing, it is not clear who this man is.</p>"

1946.3.19                                 ,Luce Center Label,"<p>This three-quarter-length view of Washington is adapted from the full-scale painting by John Trumbull, commissioned by the city of Charleston, South Carolina, in 1791 to commemorate Washington’s visit. In the words of the council, the painting was commissioned to ""hand down to posterity the remembrance of the man to whom they are so much indebted for the blessings of peace, liberty and independence.” Henry Brintnell Bounetheau and other miniaturists made and sold many small copies of the popular image. Here he omitted the horse and Washington’s aide-de-camp, preferring to concentrate on the general himself.

Albert lived most of his life in Mexico, and this exhibition was the first significant introduction of his work to America. He worked in a variety of materials, including crystal, stone, and wood, but chose to cast many of his sculptures in bronze. <i>Ecstasy</i> retains the imprints of the artist's fingers as he worked over the original clay, and these intricately modeled surfaces enhance the sensuousness of the bronze figure.</p>"

Helen Munroe was at one time the director of publications at the Smithsonian Institution. This miniature was worn as a stickpin by the well-dressed owner. Stickpins were among the flashiest accessories available to a gentleman of this time, and this one, in particular, would have drawn attention because of the unusual close-up profile of the sitter.</p>"

It is likely that this miniature was painted during their courtship or just after their marriage in 1828. Despite her frail health, she accompanied her husband on one of his five journeys west and supported his efforts to capture the likenesses of Native Americans. She and their youngest son died while visiting Paris in 1845, a loss that devastated the artist.</p>"

The elephant that “sat” for <i>African Elephant Scenting Danger</i> had been driven mad from seeing his mate killed, and he became very agitated as Harvey modeled him. At one point, he nearly upset Harvey’s modeling stand by grabbing the leg and shaking it with his trunk. The finished sculpture shows the elephant in his most defensive stance. As he anticipates an attack, he raises his trunk to smell the air and tries to locate his enemy.</p>"

When Lawson came west from New York City, he had trouble with the vastly different landscape, and complained that ""he couldn't feel the place, . . . it was too bleak [and] forbidding."" He fought against the dizziness and shortness of breath brought on by Colorado's high altitudes, and crafted numerous scenes of the dramatic landscape. This painting won Lawson a prize at the National Academy of Design, the last major award of his career. (Leeds, <i>Ernest Lawson</i>, 2000)</p>

1949.8.2                                  ,Luce Center Label,"<p>Frank Knox Morton Rehn was known primarily as a marine painter whose images captured scenes along the <st1:State><st1:place>Massachusetts</st1:place></st1:State> coast. This painting depicts a stretch of beach in <st1:City><st1:place>Gloucester</st1:place></st1:City>, a popular East Coast tourist destination throughout the nineteenth century. The scene is dominated by sky and sea, yet Rehn avoided using shades of blue and instead chose warmer tones of brown and red. This limited use of color emphasizes the dark shadows under the approaching waves, making them appear much bigger than they really are. This, combined with the deserted beach, evokes the latent power of the sea in a view that initially appears calm.</p>"
1950.10.2                                 ,Luce Center Label,"<p>Family lore holds that this brooch pin features the portrait of an illegitimate son of George Washington, fathered when Washington was eighteen years old. Washington lent financial support to neighbors and members of his extended family at Mount Vernon, making it difficult to determine how accurate that legend is. One theory is that this is the likeness of Corbin Washington (1765-1799), who married Hannah Lee, a daughter of Richard Henry Lee, in whose family this miniature descended.</p>"
1950.10.3                                 ,Luce Center Label,"<p>It is not always possible to identify the sitter in a miniature portrait, and research is still being done on some of the works in the Museum’s collection. Miniatures became popular in England during the early 1700s, commissioned by wealthy families on the occasions of births, engagements, weddings, and bereavements. These paintings, elaborately set into lockets or brooches, provided the wearer with a sentimental connection to a loved one. The back of the miniature often revealed a lock of the sitter’s hair, symbolizing affection, commitment, or loss. The daguerreotype, invented in 1839, provided a cheaper, faster alternative, and portrait miniatures grew less popular. At the turn of the twentieth century, with the establishment of the American Society of Miniature Painters, miniatures enjoyed a brief revival.</p>"

Thayer believed that the coloration of animals, no matter how eye-catching, was meant to disguise them in nature through what he called “countershading.” Even bright pink flamingoes would vanish against a similar colored sky at sunset or sunrise. No matter that at times their brilliant feathers were highly visible, their coloration would protect them from predators at crucial moments so that “the spectator seems to see right through the space occupied by an opaque animal.”</p>

<p>Not all readers were convinced. The most passionate criticism came from Teddy Roosevelt, who was in Africa when the book came out. He protested upon his return that Thayer’s theory was ludicrous, arguing that on his trip he had spotted some of the animals Thayer mentioned from miles away.

Curators questioned this identification after comparing it to life portraits of the prince, whose features differ noticeably from those of this man. But the sitter’s long hair, lace collar, and elaborate sleeves mark him as a cavalier, a supporter of the king in the civil war that eventually drove Cornelius Johnson to Holland. When the portrait was painted, Johnson was still in England, where he held the distinction of “his Majesty’s servant in the quality of Picture drawer.” (Shaw, <I>The Seventeenth-century Gaze</I>, 1987) This painting came to the Smithsonian through Ralph Cross Johnson, who worked as an attorney in Maine and in Washington. Johnson built an impressive collection of European and American art, which he bequeathed to the National Collection."

During his lifetime, Rubens’s works were much admired and copied by other artists, as in this portrait done by an unidentified artist. Paintings by Rubens, and copies of them, were also popular among nineteenth-century American collectors. <i>Harper’s Weekly</i> and other magazines fed public interest in Rubens, printing stories about his family and his beautiful wife Helena. In 1877, <i>Harper’s</i> described her as a “proud, stately lady in rich costume, her countenance expressive of languid complacency,” attributes nicely captured in this seventeenth-century portrait.</p>"

(Westermann, “Jan Miense Molenaer in the Comic Mode,” in Weller, <i>Jan Miense Molenaer: Painter of the Dutch Golden Age,</i> 2002). The work was part of the collection of Ralph Cross Johnson, a Harvard-educated lawyer who was described at the time of his death as “One of the greatest patrons of art in the country” (<i>The Washington Post</i>, July 10, 1923). Johnson gave the Smithsonian American Art Museum (then the National Collection of Fine Arts) forty-one old-master paintings, which filled an entire gallery of the Museum.

Steen’s paintings, copies of them, and works by his followers were popular on the American art market in the late nineteenth century. They appealed to collectors of various backgrounds, from lawyers like Ralph Cross Johnson to senators and financiers. Many of these patrons believed that the Dutch Republic was the source of American political ideals, a connection popularized through two best-selling books by nineteenth-century American historian John Lothrop Motley, who couched the Dutch struggle for independence in terms of the American Revolution.

As he read about the Mohawk Valley, he wrote that he had found “some of the most interesting and exciting material I have ever looked into.” He decided to paint a scene of an abolitionist farmer helping escaped slaves as day breaks at Brockett Farm, one of the two Underground Railroad stops near Dolgeville. Newell chose a muted palette of browns, blues, and greens to convey the secrecy and danger involved in this activity. He structured his composition so that the expansive hills stretch into the background, symbolizing the long journey the runaway slaves had made through the night. Newell highlighted the heroism of the slaves and the people who helped them by showing a man leaning into lantern light to read a flyer offering a reward for his capture.

These paintings, elaborately set into lockets or brooches, provided the wearer with a sentimental connection to a loved one. The back of the miniature often revealed a lock of the sitter’s hair, symbolizing affection, commitment, or loss.

He found these men harvesting ice off lakes and streams as local men had done every winter since the early 1800s. They sawed the thick layer of natural ice into long strips and then cut off large blocks. As Gottlieb's painting shows, the red-faced workers dressed in warm coats used long hooks and wooden ramps to maneuver the slick, heavy ice into large commercial icehouses where they neatly stacked the blocks. Straw or sawdust packing minimized melting in warm weather. Throughout the year icehouses along the Hudson River stored ice that was shipped by train to New York City. Families and grocers put the ice into insulated iceboxes that kept food from spoiling. Artificial freezing dominated ice production after World War I, and then electric refrigerators became popular.

Celentano contrasted the solemnity of the traditional procession with the swing band on a platform at the right, which blares out popular tunes for people dancing joyfully in the street. A market, providing familiar fare to the throngs, includes a fish seller, a pizza vendor, and a butcher hawking their wares in front of a spaghetti house. </p> <p>The lively scene, evoking the scents of tasty Italian food, is overshadowed by the immense natural-gas tanks at the right that once blighted Manhattan's immigrant slums. Only those too poor to live elsewhere settled in the Gashouse District along the East River, where the gas plants leaked noxious fumes. By the time of Celentano’s painting, however, the gas plants had nearly vanished, along with the worst of the nineteenth-century slums.<p><i>1934: A New Deal for Artists</i> exhibition label"

However, the sky seen above the mountain and reflected in Sky Pond is the brilliant blue of midday. The snows of Taylor Glacier glow blue-white between the rugged boulders, showing how cold it is in the high Rockies even when the slopes are clad in summer greenery. Smith's sun-drenched colors and grand mountain scenery evoked a wild paradise all too distant for those caught in the gritty urban poverty of Depression-era America. </p> <p>Smith probably encountered the Civilian Conservation Corps, a work relief program for young men, as he explored the Colorado Rockies in search of picturesque landscapes.

This serene painting speaks of the deep love Hennings felt for Taos, New Mexico, where he was a leading member of the artists' colony. His subjects walk quietly through the snow together as the sun sets behind them. In works like this, Hennings created poetic visual connections between the people of Taos and the stunning high desert where they lived. Here the artist contrasts the man's warm blanket, lit by the golden sunset, with the cold covering of snow on the ground, cast into blue shadows by the hills in the west. Hennings links the two figures to their home landscape by likening them to the tall native sunflowers standing against the sky with their long stalks gracefully intertwined. While many PWAP artists documented timely scenes of the Great Depression, Hennings chose to celebrate the continuity of local traditions.<p><i>1934: A New Deal for Artists</i> exhibition label"

The Russian emigrant Bolotowsky induced fellow immigrants to pose for him. He noted, ""All the four people in this picture were very carefully selected and are especially fitted for it: the barber a handsome Italian, the customers a Greek, the next one a nervous slim Irishman, the last one a heavy tough Irishman sitting clumsily in a dainty chair.""

He based the image on visits to the Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River and the Davis Dam on the Colorado River. Gropper organized the composition in three parts to accommodate a second-floor lobby wall divided by two marble pilasters. Each scene represents different phases of construction to show the drama, danger, and massive scale of the dam projects overseen by the government. </p><p>In the central panel a worker stands inside a section of conduit suspended above the canyon. He signals for his coworkers to direct the crane over the dam. Gropper emphasized the unity of workers who clearly rely on one another to get the job done. The men protect each other from injury as they shape the American landscape, invigorate the nation's economy, and provide electrification across the country. The stylized clouds and jagged mountains reflect the artist's effort to make the scene easily readable from a distance. In the finished mural, Gropper made subtle changes to his proposal, including a red handkerchief hanging from the back pocket of one of the workers. Gropper was a Communist, and this subtle statement of his sympathies was a subversive act for an artist whose government-commissioned work was supposed to reach broad audiences. The change generated no objections, and after Gropper installed the mural a <i>Washington Post</i> critic commended him, writing that his ""design has unity and is appropriate in scale and color to the space for which it was planned.""

Those who violate the unwritten rule do so furtively. A woman takes a quiet sidelong glance at the newspaper read by the man next to her, while a man steals a peek at a young woman applying lipstick. Only two women in the foreground, who obviously know each other, dare to look directly at each other as they talk companionably.</p> <p>Furedi takes a friendly interest in her fellow subway riders, portraying them sympathetically.

Artist Ray Strong painted looking north from the San Francisco side to the hills of Marin County, where the first bright orange tower rises. Tugboats and a freighter sailing across the deep blue waters typify the busy shipping that would routinely pass beneath the span. The bridge therefore had to have the highest deck ever built. The two massive concrete structures in the foreground are anchors for the cables supporting the deck. The vast structures on the San Francisco side dwarf the men working around the anchorages and pylons. Strong's painting, with its intense colors and active brushwork, conveys an infectious optimism. Hundreds of tourists who shared the artist's excitement came to gaze at this amazing project that continued despite the financial strains of the Great Depression and the disastrous storm that washed away a trestle on Halloween of 1933.

The frustrated ape at the center of the painting is reminiscent of the chimps in the Tarzan movies.

He wanted the murals to convey the history and heritage of the area, and specified that Klitgaard’s view of the Hudson River’s west shore date to 1840, when the river traffic was at its height. Klitgaard took great care to comply with the president’s demands, visiting the Poughkeepsie library on several occasions to study maps and surveys from the mid-nineteenth century.

Here, the expressive brushstrokes create a sense of movement in the peaks and bells of the jester’s hat, which wave in all directions. Browne abstracted the details of the jester’s profile to create a colorful jumble of shapes, from the zigzags of his eyelashes to the curved form of his cheekbone. The artist was an early proponent of abstract art in the 1930s, but when he painted <i>Jester,</i> in 1952, a younger crowd of “action painters” commanded the critics’ attention. The foolish character in this painting might symbolize Browne himself, whose work seemed dated by comparison. Or, the painter may have compared the dominance of abstract expressionism to the jester’s absurd rule of the court.</p>"

Small paintings of eyes first became popular during the late eighteenth century. They reminded wearers of a loved one, whose identity remained a secret. The single eye also symbolized the watchful gaze of a jealous partner, who feared that his or her lover might stray. One of the earliest known eye miniatures was painted in 1786 by the English artist Richard Cosway for the Prince of Wales, later King George IV. The miniature showed the eye of Mrs. Fitzherbert, the prince's mistress. The eye miniatures shown in the Luce Center would have been set in lockets, brooches, rings, or small boxes.</p>"

He originally exaggerated the figure's facial features, which many of his contemporaries criticized as African American caricatures, but later altered the painting.

But the title may have been a testament to the artist's faith in God's plan, and in fact, Borglum did enjoy success again. (A. Mervyn Davies, <i>Solon H.

The work was so provocatively lifelike that certain exhibition venues in the United States required that men and women view the sculpture separately. Powers justified the sculpture's full nudity by claiming his work depicted historic events: a Greek woman, captured by Ottoman forces during the War of Independence, had been stripped and chained for sale at a slave market in Constantinople. American viewers in the 1840s and '50s, many of whom had never before seen a sculpture of a nude woman, felt licensed to admire the <EM>Greek Slave</EM> because she was ""clothed all over with sentiment."" Powers encouraged this interpretation of his work and indicated his subject's modesty by turning the figure's gaze demurely downward and including a cross and locket as symbols of Christian piety and faithfulness to a remembered loved one. The <EM>Greek Slave</EM> was almost immediately associated with slavery in the United States, where abolitionists used images of it to promote their cause.

<P><EM>Greek Slave</EM> became the most famous sculpture of the nineteenth century and propelled the artist, Hiram Powers (1805-73), to international stardom. The work was so provocatively lifelike that certain exhibition venues in the United States required that men and women view the sculpture separately. Powers justified the sculpture's full nudity by claiming his work depicted historic events: a Greek woman, captured by Ottoman forces during the War of Independence, had been stripped and chained for sale at a slave market in Constantinople. American viewers in the 1840s and '50s, many of whom had never before seen a sculpture of a nude woman, felt licensed to admire the <EM>Greek Slave</EM> because she was ""clothed all over with sentiment."" Powers encouraged this interpretation of his work and indicated his subject's modesty by turning the figure's gaze demurely downward and including a cross and locket as symbols of Christian piety and faithfulness to a remembered loved one. The <EM>Greek Slave</EM> was almost immediately associated with slavery in the United States, where abolitionists used images of it to promote their cause. Powers produced six full-scale marble examples of the <EM>Greek Slave</EM>, each considered an original work of art. Much to Powers' dismay, the sculpture became so popular that countless unauthorized imitations of <EM>Greek Slave</EM> were also made.</P>"

In 1832 he became one of the first American artists to receive a national commission when Congress asked him to create a sculpture of George Washington for the United States Capitol. The statue is now in the collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Greenough must have been an inspiration to Powers, who was the same age and following a similar career path, and in this bust the strong features and confident expression evoke a young, successful man who was proud of his early achievements.</p>"

The total work suggests a chancel complete with altar, a throne, offertory tables, pulpits, mercy seats, and other obscure objects of Hampton's own invention. His work also includes plaques, tags, and notebooks bearing a secret writing system which has yet to be, and may never be, deciphered.</p>  <p>Hampton's intricate, large-scale design for <i>The Throne</i> derives coherence from parallel rows of constructions, densely packed on several levels. A seven-foot tall cushioned throne at the rear center is the work's focal point. Pairs of objects on either side of it impart a powerful, compulsive sense of symmetry. To the actual throne's right, objects refer to the New Testament and Jesus; to the left, the Old Testament and Moses, a division that corresponds to the disposition of the saved in the Bible. Every item has a relationship to the others and most bear a dedication to a saint, prophet, or other biblical character that may have appeared in the recurrent visions that inspired Hampton's efforts.</p>  <p>Massive wings, suggesting angels, sprout from most components; framed tablets line the walls, and crowns and other complex foil decorations fill every available space of the assemblage. The entire complex was originally placed on a three-foot tall platform set stage like against the rear wall of his garage.</p>  <p><i>The Throne</i> and all of its associated components are made from discarded materials and found objects consisting of old furniture, wooden planks and supports, cardboard cutouts, scraps of insulation board, discarded light bulbs, jelly glasses, hollow cardboard cylinders, Kraft paper, desk blotters, mirror fragments and electrical cables and a variety of other ""found objects,"" all scavenged from second-hand shops, the streets, or the federal office buildings in which he worked. To complete each element, Hampton used shimmering metallic foils and brilliant purple paper (now faded to tan) to evoke spiritual awe and splendor. Hampton's symbolism extended even to his choice of materials such as light bulbs, which represent God as the light of the world.</p>   <p>Praised as America's greatest work of visionary art, Hampton's <i>Throne</i> reveals one man's faith in God as well as his hope for salvation.  Although Hampton did not live to initiate a public ministry, the capping phrase ""FEAR NOT"" summarizes his project's universally eloquent message.</p><p>Exhibition Label, Smithsonian American Art Museum, 2006"

At a party given at William Merritt Chase's studio, she met Augustus Saint-Gaudens, who asked to create her portrait. Her brother agreed, promising in return to paint the sculptor's son, Homer. This relief panel is slightly curved, so that it captures the light and the bronze takes on different colors. <p>Saint-Gaudens made unusual choices to create this work. This was part of an informal exchange of tokens between artists, but the sculptor gave the portrait the monumental and timeless gravity of a public memorial. The sculptor chose not to give Violet a conventional, formal pose, but caught her in the act of humming a pitch and tuning her guitar, as though she would shortly sing for her friends. Like an ancient Greek grave marker, this relief captures a fleeting and informal moment in Violet's life. It compresses into one image a love of music, learning, and art that characterized the circle of friends and fellow artists around the Sargents.<p>Exhibition Label, Smithsonian American Art Museum, 2006"

Four years later the parish commissioned Augustus Saint-Gaudens to create this commemorative portrait. In earlier versions, the sculptor represented Vinton at the pulpit with his arm raised in speech. The final version, however, does not present the rector as an orator, but as a scholarly theologian clasping a Bible to his chest, his fingers marking various pages.</p>"

The city represents Ypres in western Belgium, the site of a major battle during the first year of World War I. The emblem on Rubinstein's shoulder evokes the bloodshed of war, but the brilliant red may also signal the painter's passion for the actress.

Like Brooks, Gluck frequently wore clothing inspired by men's fashions that concealed her feminine figure. This androgynous attire was popular among upper- and upper-middle-class women at the time. It allowed them to experiment with fashion, but it also provided an outlet for lesbians, like Gluck and Brooks, to question traditional gender roles. In a 1918 letter to her brother, Gluck wrote of her new look, ""I am flourishing in a new garb. Intensely exciting. Everybody likes it,"" and went on to say, ""I hope you will like it because I intend to wear that sort of thing always.""

These paintings, elaborately set into lockets or brooches, provided the wearer with a sentimental connection to a loved one. The back of the miniature often revealed a lock of the sitter’s hair, symbolizing affection, commitment, or loss. The daguerreotype, invented in 1839, provided a cheaper, faster alternative, and portrait miniatures grew less popular.

Here, the network of sharply drawn lines and transparent planes advancing and receding in space echoes this earlier technique. Pereira wanted her abstract paintings not only to give visible form to the latest discoveries in physics, biochemistry, and other sciences, but also to convey the mystical effects of light and color.

Color Field artists abandoned figural representation to explore the expressive power of color, applying it across large canvases to see how different colors relate to one another and to emphasize the canvas's flat surface. Downing favored simple geometric forms, usually circles, which he carefully placed to form precise patterns. In <i>Red Span,</i> red, yellow, blue and black shapes arc gracefully around one another, the colors enlivened by a slender wedge of exposed canvas. Downing, like many Color Field painters, did not prime his canvases, a technique that allowed his pigments to soak into the weave, creating a more saturated, vivid appearance.</p>"

He was still a student at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris and this was the first year that he succeeded in exhibiting work at the prestigious Paris Salon. Many artists spent time at Pont-Aven during the nineteenth century, looking for a “primitive” experience that was very different from modern life in Paris. Bridgman and his fellow artists passed their days painting from models such as this young peasant girl. Bright light illuminates the girl’s cheek, nose, and dress, but the long lock of dark hair casts most of her face into shadow. She looks down, intent on winding the ribbon around her hair and apparently oblivious to the presence of the painter. Bridgman’s warm colors and sensitive brushstrokes capture the innocence of a girl not yet old enough to “put up” her hair as grown women would do.</p>"

The black shape at the bottom of this image reflects the artist's movement as he applied paint in one wide, twisting brushstroke.

His technique demanded that his sitters keep their eyes shut, and the resulting faces remain impassive while the body alone communicates. Pop art gave him the freedom to try his unorthodox technique of body casting, which had always been against the rules of serious sculpture. Segal rejected the ""rule"" against casting, as he had rejected the pressure to paint abstractions in the 1950s.

In the distance, Marsh painted a cloud of smoke using a thin oil wash, creating a backdrop that is both delicate and dense. Together, the distant smoke clouds and those coming from the locomotives obscure much of the sky. The painting's gritty colors reflect the urban environment of Jersey City, which was a manufacturing center in the years preceding World War II. Railroads, however, were the biggest employer and owned a third of the city's nearly fifteen square miles. It was here that the national train networks terminated (Andrew Jacobs, ""A City Whose Time Has Come Again,"" <i>New York Times</i>, April 30, 2000). </p>"

Barile's lively ""nocturne"" shows moviegoers filtering in and out of the theater under a marquee advertising the main feature, <i>The Moon is Blue.</i> Directed by Otto Preminger, this 1953 comedy film caused an uproar when it appeared on the big screen. The story revolves around a virginal young actress pursued by a playboy architect. Preminger released the film without the approval of the Motion Picture Production Code, since he refused to remove such words from the script as ""pregnant"" and ""seduce,"" language considered objectionable at the time. The director's rebellion was great publicity, and huge crowds flocked to see a movie that, as Barile's marquee advertises, was ""spiced by more than a dash of sex.""</p>"

<P>Ceremonial dances, which are central to the religion, spirituality, and community ties of the Pueblo peoples, are among the most important subjects of Awa Tsireh's paintings. Many ritual events are held to unify families and to ensure agricultural success, and are tied to the seasons of the year. Awa Tsireh depicted primarily the dances of his own San Ildefonso Pueblo in New Mexico, but unlike most of his peers, he also painted rituals held at our Pueblos. Many of the dances are open to the public, but others are reserved only for members of the village. Awa Tsireh was careful to guard the secret rituals from outside eyes.</P>"

Although Renaissance nudes inspired these paintings, Cox updated his versions of the theme. Here, for example, he did not smooth the model’s dimpled flesh or frizzy hair, making her more natural and less idealized. The female nude was Cox’s favorite subject, despite his mother’s objections. When she complained to him that such paintings were “not pleasing,” he responded adamantly: “It is just such a feeling that makes great art impossible in this country . . .

The elder Cox had been governor of Ohio and secretary of the Interior under President Grant, and Cox designed a decorative tablet listing his father’s accomplishments for a small vestibule. After he completed the project, the administrators wanted Cox to come up with another design to complement it. He decided to include a tribute to his mother, Helen Finney Cox, who had made a name for herself in Ohio as a promoter of social work. This study shows Cox’s plan for a lunette titled “The Spirit of Self-Sacrificing Love,” based on what he described as his mother’s “Biblical charity.” Cox’s depiction of a laurel-crowned, winged figure holding a glowing torch pleased university administrators, who adopted it as the official seal on college publications.

Many artists chose mythological or allegorical scenes. In this study, Kenyon Cox represented industry as a muscular young man and science as a laurel-crowned, toga-clad woman. The ruddy skin of the male figure contrasts sharply with the white toga and milky skin of the goddess, a choice Cox made so that the figures, posed closely together, would read clearly from a distance in the finished mural. Cox believed that mythological figures provided more beautiful decoration than figures dressed in contemporary clothes. He once wrote that “The painter who cares greatly for the expressiveness of the body will feel little attraction to belt buckles and brass buttons” (Morgan, <i>Keepers of Culture</i>, 1989).</p>"

He meticulously planned every detail of a work and created several sketches and studies before its final execution. <i>Study for Drapery of ""Pursuit of the Ideal""</i> illustrates one of the numerous steps in his artistic process. The white drapery covers the lower half of a barely sketched woman. The dramatic folds in the fabric help show the contours of the figure, for which Cox would have created separate studies.

This mural study shows how he worked out his color scheme. Before deciding on the facial expressions of his figures, Cox balanced the figural groups.

Cox’s attention to harmonizing colors reflects his idea of painting as a selection of colors and forms chosen to make the most unified image. (Morgan, <i>Keepers of Culture</i>, 1989)</span></p>"

In 1898 the National Society of Mural Painters nominated Kenyon Cox and nine other members to create murals for the new state appellate court building in New York City. The space given to Cox was the most challenging: Only four feet high and thirty-five feet long, it had two smaller, angled areas at each end. He chose to paint allegorical figures symbolizing the principles of law. This study for the figure of Force shows a woman wearing a helmet and looking out with a formidable expression; it is the kind of detailed sketch Cox made of each figure before beginning the mural.

Cox chose an allegorical scene to represent the city’s booming economy. Mercury, god of commerce, drops golden coins into the lap of an allegorical figure of Cleveland, shown as an idealized woman. Cox used a grid system to translate the image onto a much larger canvas, which would be installed in an elaborately carved frame on the wall. He decided on a color scheme to match the dark brown wood of the walnut walls and the purple marble of the chimney mantle, explaining that “It seemed best to make the decoration a spot of brilliant color in its rich and quiet surroundings.” (Morgan, <i>Kenyon Cox, 1856-1919: A Life in American Art</i>, 1994)</p>"

Like other songs of resistance, the spiritual uses encoded language that would have been familiar to slaves. ""Home"" could mean either heaven or land of freedom. The lines ""I looked over Jordan and what did I see/Coming for to carry me home/A band of angels coming after me"" refers to the town of Ripley, Ohio, which was a station on the Underground Railroad. The town is located on a hill across the Ohio River, a difficult point of the journey to freedom. At this juncture, the fugitive slaves had to wait for helpers to arrive before they could continue.

A century before Catlin’s arrival in the West, the Missouria controlled the fur trade on the river that bears their name; their dominance, however, was under constant assault from the Osages, who eventually won.

As the young daughter of an Arikara chief, however, Sweet-scented Grass possessed status in the tribe and the means to dress in “a robe of the young buffalo’s skin, tastefully and elaborately embroidered” in northern Plains style.

The scars on his breast, arms, and legs show that he has several times in his life submitted to the propitiatory tortures represented in four paintings.” Four Bears had earned the right to wear his horned headdress and his fabled shirt, but even in “undress” he was a hero of the highest order, straight out of the Roman Republic: “His breasts have been bared and scarred in defence of his country, and his brows crowned with honours that elevate him conspicuous above all of his nation.” Four Bears also bears scars from his successful completion of the O-kee-pa, an important Mandan ritual performed annually to initiate the most promising young men of the tribe.

There are very many, of both sexes, and of every age, from infancy to manhood and old age, with hair of a bright silvery grey; and in some instances almost perfectly white. This singular and eccentric appearance is much oftener seen among the women than it is with the men; for many of the latter who have it, seem ashamed of it, and artfully conceal it, by filling their hair with glue and black and red earth. The women, on the other hand, seem proud of it, and display it often in an almost incredible profusion, which spreads over their shoulders and falls as low as the knee. I have ascertained, on a careful enquiry, that about one in ten or twelve of the whole tribe are what the French call ‘cheveux gris,’ or greyhairs; and that this strange and unaccountable phenomenon is not the result of disease or habit; but that it is unquestionably a hereditary character which runs in families, and indicates no inequality in disposition or intellect. And by passing this hair through my hands, as I often have, I have found it uniformly to be as coarse and harsh as a horse’s mane; differing materially from the hair of other colours, which amongst the Mandans, is generally as fine and as soft as silk.” Catlin painted Sha-kó-ka at a Mandan village in 1832.

His hair was very profuse, and flowing over his shoulders; and in his hand he held a beautiful Sioux pipe, which had just been presented to him by Mr. M’Kenzie, the Trader.

Catlin described her as “comely, and beautifully dressed; her dress of the mountain-sheep skins, tastefully ornamented with quills and beads, and her hair plaited in large braids, that hung down on her breast.” Catlin depicted Bathes Her Knees in an elegant dress of mountain-sheep skins embroidered with both quills and beads in the geometric designs favored by the Cheyenne.

The dignified bearing of the young men and the attention to detail in the elaborately beaded tunics and beaded and feathered hair reflect Catlin’s regard for his subjects. Native Americans, he wrote, were “the finest models in all Nature, unmasked and moving in all their grace and beauty.” Catlin's faithful effort to document the life of these peoples in the early nineteenth century captures those impressive cultures as they were before their world was shattered.

The young man’s true identity has been the subject of some speculation. A similar image of a Chinook boy appears in McKenney and Hall’s three-volume study, <i>The Indian Tribes of North America</i> (1933).

Buffalo Bull’s Back Fat (named after a prized cut of bison) was a chief of the Blackfoot, a tribe of the northernmost Plains whose territory straddled the present-day border between the United States and Canada. Catlin considered the people of the northern Plains the least corrupted by white contact, and he helped establish their image as nature’s noble people in Europe as well as America. This commanding portrait, for example, was exhibited to favorable notice in the Paris Salon of 1846. (Gurney and Heyman, eds., <i>George Catlin and His Indian Gallery</i>, 2002)</p>"

I have painted him at full length, with a head-dress made entirely of ermine skins and horns of the buffalo. This custom of wearing horns beautifully polished and surmounting the head-dress, is a very curious one, being worn only by the bravest of the brave; by the most extraordinary men in the nation . . . When he stood for his picture, he also held a lance and two ‘medicine-bags’ in his hand.” This portrait, painted at Fort Union, bears a certificate signed by the Indian agent John Sanford. George Catlin called upon fur traders, army officials, and government Indian agents to certify the accuracy of his pictures, an important testimonial for the artist who insisted that the value of his work lay in its authenticity.

According to the artist, the medicine man began the healing by administering roots and herbs. If this failed, he would try “shaking his frightful rattles, and singing songs of incantation.” Catlin wrote that the medicine man’s clothing often consisted of “the skins of snakes, and frogs, and bats,---beaks and tows and tails of birds,---hoofs of deer, goats, and antelopes,” each possessing “anomalies or deformities,” which gave them their healing power. This healer wore the skin of a yellow bear attached with the hides of snakes. Catlin actually owned the costume, and he sometimes wore it to enhance the spectacle of his Indian Gallery.

Two years later, he began the first of several journeys deep into the western frontier, boarding the steamboat <i>Yellowstone</i> at St. Louis for a two-thousand-mile run up the Missouri River to Fort Union. The fort, an outpost maintained by the American Fur Company, brought Catlin in contact with the Blackfoot and Crow. Among the masterful portraits he made on that journey is this image of the Crow chief Four Wolves. The chief, Catlin later wrote, was “in mourning for a brother; and according to their custom, [he] cut off a number of locks of his long hair, which is as much as a man can well spare of so valued an ornament, which he has been for the greater part of his life cultivating.” (Catlin, <i>Letters and Notes</i>, vol. 1, no. 8, 1841, reprint 1973; Truettner, <i>The Natural Man Observed</i>, 1979)</p>"

I observed the other day, that most of them were over six feet high and very many of these have cultivated their natural hair to such an almost incredible length, that it sweeps the ground as they walk; there are frequent instances of this kind amongst them, and in some cases, a foot or more it will drag on the grass as they walk, giving exceeding grace and beauty their movements. They usually oil their hair with a profusion of bear grease every morning, which is no doubt one cause of the unusual length to which their hair extends; though it cannot be the sole cause of it, for the other tribes throughout this country use the bear's grease in equal profusion without producing the same results.” George Catlin painted this work at Fort Union in the upper Midwest in 1832.

Catlin probably painted the Ottawa chief at Mackinac, an island in Lake Huron where a remnant of the tribe remained. He described Big Sail as “blind in one eye,” and thought the “effects of whiskey and civilization . . . plainly discernible in this instance.” (Catlin, 1848 Catalogue, Catlin’s Indian Gallery, SAAM online exhibition; Truettner, <i>The Natural Man Observed</i>, 1979)</p>"

The numbers of this tribe do not exceed four thousand; and the most of them have sold even their guns and ammunition for whiskey.

With these mysteries he made his way through most of the North Western tribes, enlisting warriors wherever he went, to assist Tecumseh in effecting his great scheme, of forming a confederacy of all the Indians on the frontier, to drive back the whites and defend the Indians’ rights; which he told them could never in any other way be protected . . .

He wore three ostrich feathers in his head, and a turban made of a vari-coloured cotton shawl---and his dress was chiefly of calicos, with a handsome bead sash or belt around his waist, and his rifle in his hand. This young man is, no doubt, an extraordinary character, as he has been for some years reputed, and doubtless looked upon by the Seminoles as the master spirit and leader of the tribe, although he is not a chief . . . In stature he is about at mediocrity, with an elastic and graceful movement; in his face he is good looking, with rather an effeminate smile; but of so peculiar a character, that the world may be ransacked over without finding another just like it.

After the War of 1812, the United States Army built a small fort called Fort Armstrong near the western tip of the island; the intent was to keep the Mississippi River open to traffic and to protect the settlers soon to be arriving from the east. After witnessing a treaty there in 1835, George Catlin discussed some of its provisions: “The Sacs and Foxes are already drawing an annuity of 27,000 dollars, for thirty years to come, in cash; and by the present Treaty just concluded that amount will be enlarged to 37,000 dollars per annum. This Treaty with the Sacs and Foxes, held at Rock Island, was for the purchase of a tract of land of 256,000 acres, lying on the Ioway river, West of the Mississippi, a reserve which was made in the tract of land conveyed to the Government by Treaty after the Sac war, and known as the ‘Black Hawk purchase.’ The Treaty has been completed by Governor Dodge, by stipulating on the part of Government to pay them seventy-five cents per acre for the reserve, (amounting to 192,000 dollars).” (Catlin, <i>Letters and Notes</i>, vol. 2, no. 56, 1841; reprint 1973)</p>"

Catlin wrote: “There is no more beautiful prairie country in the world, than that which is to be seen in this vicinity . . . The surface of the country is gracefully and slightly undulating, like the swells of the retiring ocean after a heavy storm.” He was no less captivated by the landscape on his trip up the Mississippi in 1835.

He was not the first white man to visit the sacred quarry, but he was the first to record its appearance. He wrote of the journey and the site: “For many miles we had the Coteau in view in the distance before us, which looked like a blue cloud settling down in the horizon . . . On the very top of this mound or ridge, we found the far-famed quarry or fountain of the Red Pipe, which is truly an anomaly in nature. The principal and most striking feature of this place, is a perpendicular wall of close-grained, compact quartz, of twenty-five and thirty feet in elevation, running nearly North and South with its face to the West, exhibiting a front of nearly two miles in length, when it disappears at both ends by running under the prairie . . . At the base of this wall there is a level prairie, of half a mile in width, running parallel to it; in any and all parts of which, the Indians procure the red stone for their pipes, by digging through the soil and several slaty layers of the red stone, to the depth of four or five feet. From the very numerous marks of ancient and modern diggings or excavations, it would appear that this place has been for many centuries resorted to for the red stone; and from the great number of graves and remains of ancient fortifications in its vicinity, it would seem, as well as from their actual traditions, that the Indian tribes have long held this place in high superstitious estimation; and also that it has been the resort of different tribes, who have made their regular pilgrimages here to renew their pipes.” (Truettner, <i>The Natural Man Observed</i>, 1979; Gurney and Heyman, eds., <i>George Catlin and His Indian Gallery</i>, 2002)</p>"

He journeyed west by steamer from New York through Sault Ste. Marie and Green Bay, paddling down the Wisconsin River, where he sketched this image of Winnebago Indians hunting ducks. Although familiar with the West’s stunning landscape since beginning his travels in 1830, Catlin found the country’s beauty---and his enthusiasm for it---inexhaustible. He later described the Wisconsin River as what “the French most appropriately denominate ‘La belle riviere,’ [it] may certainly vie with any other on the Continent . . . for its beautifully skirted banks and prairie bluffs. It may justly be said to be equal to the Mississippi . . .” (Catlin, <i>Letters and Notes</i>, vol. 2, no. 54, 1841, reprint 1973; Truettner, <i>The Natural Man Observed</i>, 1979)</p>"

The valley, for a mile distant about the village, seemed speckled with horses and mules that were grazing in it. The chiefs of the war-party requested the regiment to halt, until they could ride in, and inform their people who were coming. We then dismounted for an hour or so; when we could see them busily running and catching their horses; and at length, several hundreds of their braves and warriors came out at full speed to welcome us, and forming in a line in front of us, as we were again mounted, presented a formidable and pleasing appearance.

All of his portraits feature an indistinct background and either a bust-length or full-length view of his subject. Every choice he made was intended to document as much information about the subject’s outward appearance as possible. In this portrait of a Navajo woman, Burbank shows Estzan-Nap-Pa full length in order to display her dress. By turning her head just slightly to provide a three-quarter view of her face, Burbank also emphasized the woman’s features. Burbank was interested in systems of classification that categorized people’s behavior according to their appearance. He believed it was more important to preserve Native American “types” for future study than to capture his sitter’s personality. He wrote that his portraits “would be valuable to a Museum as it will not be long before [the Indians are] all gone forever.” (Wolfe, <i>American Indian Portraits: Elbridge Ayer Burbank in the West (1897-1910)</i>, 2000)</p>"

On my way up the river I made a painting of this lovely spot, taken from the summit of the bluffs, a mile or two distant, shewing an encampment of Sioux, of six hundred tents or skin lodges, around the Fort, where they had concentrated to make their spring trade; exchanging their furs and peltries for articles and luxuries of civilized manufactures.” (Catlin, <i>Letters and Notes,</i> vol. 1, no. 26, 1841; reprint 1973)</p><p></p>"

He stood stiffened up, and swelling with awful vengeance, which was sublime for a picture, but which he could not vent upon me.

A spirited dance then ensued; and, in a confused manner, every one sung forth his own deeds of bravery in ejaculatory gutturals, which were almost deafening; and they danced up, two at a time to the stakes, and after spitting several times upon the liver and hearts, catched a piece in their mouths, bit it off and swallowed it.

Whilst dashing about thus, each one, with a heavy whip in his hand, as he came within reach of the group on the ground, selected the one to whom he decided to present his horse, and as he passed him, gave him the most tremendous cut with his lash, over his naked shoulders; and as he darted around again he plied the whip as before and again and again, with a violent ‘crack!’ until I the blood could be seen trickling down over his naked shoulders, upon which he instantly dismounted, and placed the bridle and whip In his hands . . .” George Catlin skeched this scene at a Sac and Fox village in 1835.

Each horse drags his load, and each dog, <i>i.e.</i> each dog that <i>will</i> do it (and there are many that will <i>not</i>), also dragging his wallet on a couple of poles; and each squaw with her load, and all together (notwithstanding their burthens) cherishing their pugnacious feelings, which often bring them into general conflict, commencing usually amongst the dogs, and sure to result in fisticuffs of the women; whilst the men, riding leisurely on the right or the left, take infinite pleasure in overlooking these desperate conflicts, at which they are sure to have a laugh, and in which, as sure never to lend a hand.” George Catlin sketched this image at a Comanche village in 1834.

The buffalo, however, is a huge and furious animal, and when his retreat is cut off, makes desperate and deadly resistance, contending to the last moment for the right of life---and oftentimes deals death by wholesale, to his canine assailants, which he is tossing into the air or stamping to death under his feet.” George Catlin sketched the wolves on the Upper Missouri in 1832.

1985.66.501                               ,Luce Center Label,"<p>When the lasso falls over the neck of a wild horse, George Catlin wrote, the Indian “instantly dismounts, leaving his own horse, and runs as fast as he can, letting the laso pass out gradually and carefully through his hands, until the horse falls for want of breath, and lies helpless on the ground; at which time the Indian advances slowly towards the horse's head, keeping his laso tight upon its neck, until he fastens a pair of hobbles on the animal's two forefeet, and also loosens the laso (giving the horse chance to breathe), and gives it a noose around the under jaw, by which he gets great power over the affrighted animal, which is rearing and plunging when it gets breath; and by which, as he advances, hand over hand, towards the horse's nose, he is able to hold it down and prevent it from throwing itself over on its back, at the hazard of its limbs. By this means he gradually advances, until he is able to place his hand on the animal's nose, and over its eyes; and at length to breathe in its nostrils, when it soon becomes docile and conquered; so that he has little else to do than to remove the hobbles from its feet, and lead or ride it into camp.” Catlin sketched this scene on a dragoon expedition in 1834, and probably completed the painting in his studio between 1835 and 1837.

There were on this occasion about fifty young men who entered the lists, and as they went into the sacred lodge, each one's body was chiefly naked, and covered with clay of different colours; some were red, others were yellow, and some were covered with white clay, giving them the appearance of white men . . .

While the young men were sequestered inside the medicine lodge, the entire community petitioned the Great Spirit for fertility and an abundant supply of bison in a series of activities outside. Each participant in the Bull Dance wore an entire buffalo skin, head, horns, hooves, and a tail included. They repeated the dance forty times over the course of of the O-kee-pa, imitating the movements of a buffalo. “During the first three days of this solemn conclave,” Catlin wrote, “there were many very curious forms and amusements enacted in the open area in the middle of the village, and in front of the medicine-lodge, by other members of the community, one of which formed a material part or link of these strange ceremonials . . . The bull-dance . . . is repeated four times during the first day . . . and sixteen times on the fourth day; and always around the curb, or <i> ‘big canoe’</i> [the drumlike structure in the center of the open area] . . .

The annual enactment of the O-kee-pa was a four-day ritual that included the painful initiation of the most promising young men of the tribe. Catlin documented the ceremony in a series of paintings that were among the most important of his scenes of Native American rituals. The O-kee-pa began with the men sequestered inside a medicine lodge (see 1985.66.504), where the initiates underwent a four-day fast and feats of endurance that required them to be suspended from the roof of the lodge by chords anchored in their chests and shoulders. Outside the lodge, members of the Mandan tribe wearing buffalo robes performed the Bull Dance, to petition the Great Spirit for fertility and abundant bison (see 1985.66.505). The final part of the ceremony, shown here, was called the last race. The men were ushered out of the medicine lodge (“pale and ghastly from abstinence” as Catlin later wrote), and in one last test of their strength and courage, ran (or were dragged by the wrists) around the “Big Canoe,” shown here in the center of the circle.

Impressed with the Comanche warrior, he later wrote of Little Spaniard as “A gallant little fellow . . .  represented to us as one of the leading warriors of the tribe; and no doubt . . . one of the most extraordinary men at present living in these regions. He is half Spanish, and being a half-breed, for whom they generally have the most contemptuous feelings, he has been all his life thrown into the front of battle and danger; at which posts he has signalized himself, and commanded the highest admiration and respect of the tribe for his daring and adventurous career. This is the man . . . who dashed out so boldly from the war-party, and came to us with the white flag raised on the point of his lance . . . I have here represented him as he stood for me, with his shield on his arm, with his quiver slung, and his lance of fourteen feet in length in his right hand. This extraordinary little man, whose figure was light, seemed to be all bone and muscle, and exhibited immense power, by the curve of the bones in his legs and his arms. We had many exhibitions of his extraordinary strength, as well as agility; and of his gentlemanly politeness and friendship we had as frequent evidences.” (Catlin, <i>Letters and Notes</i>, vol. 2, no. 42, 1841; reprint 1973)</p>"

He called them “noble animals,” and understood that overhunting in the West would destroy them, “leaving these beautiful green fields a vast and idle waste.” He saw them “grazing on the plains of the country to which they appropriately belong.” “Their colour is a dark brown,” Catlin wrote, “but changing very much as the season varies from warm to cold; their hair or fur, from its great length in the winter and spring, and exposure to the weather, turning quite light, and almost to a jet black, when the winter coat is shed off, and a new growth is shooting out.” (Catlin, <i>Letters and Notes</i>, vol. 1, no. 31, 1841; reprint 1973)</p>"

I saw in the grass, on the bank above me, what I supposed to be the back of a fine elk, busy at his grazing. I let our craft float silently by for a little distance, when I communicated the intelligence to my men, and slily ran in, to the shore. I pricked the priming of my firelock, and taking a bullet or two in my mouth, stepped ashore, and trailing my rifle in my hand, went back under the bank, carefully crawling up in a little ravine, quite sure of my game; when, to my utter surprise and violent alarm, I found the elk to be no more nor less than an Indian pony, getting his breakfast! and a little beyond him, a number of others grazing.” (Catlin, <i>Letters and Notes,</i> vol. 1, nos. 10, 31, 1841; reprint 1973)</p><p></p>"

In the chase he was foremost; he could run down a buffalo, which he often had done, on his own legs, and drive his arrow to the heart. He was the fleetest in the tribe; and in the races he had run, he had always taken the prize.

The group of pioneers, with their backs to the viewer, follows an ox-drawn wagon into a valley. The monumental figures appear strong and assured in their forward progress. Rising mountains melt into the sun. Lundeberg's style of mixing fantastic images with reality is evident in the background: The pink, rolling mountains blend into the orange, pink, and bluish haze of the sky; it is difficult to determine where the mountains end and the sky begins. The careful use of space and dreamlike elements in <i>Pioneers of the West</i> is representative of Lundeberg's postsurrealist style.

By the end of their journeys, the pilgrim of the cross discovers the bright light and angels of redemption, but the pilgrim of the world finds only a wasteland of emptiness and fear.

But he later created several images based on biblical stories because he enjoyed combining religious symbols with semiabstract compositions (Hunter, <i>B. J. O.

In these communities, men as well as women dedicate their lives to crafting pots, but early in the twentieth century the best-known potters were women. Critcher's canvas is a tribute to the traditions handed down through generations. The matriarch of this group very likely taught the two younger women how to build a clay vessel and how to grind colored corn and other natural pigments for paint. <i>Indian Women Making Pottery</i> indirectly reflects Critcher's own success as an artist.

Here, Edmonia Lewis portrayed Cleopatra in the moment after her death, wearing her royal attire, in majestic repose on a throne. The identical sphinx heads flanking the throne represent the twins she bore with Roman general Marc Antony, while the hieroglyphics on the side have no meaning. Lewis was working at a time when Neoclassicism was a popular artistic style that favored classical, Biblical, or literary themes—thus Cleopatra was a common subject. Unlike her contemporaries who often depicted an idealized Cleopatra merely contemplating suicide, Lewis showed the queen’s death more realistically, after the asp’s venom had taken hold—an attribute viewed as “ghastly” and “absolutely repellant” in its day (William J. Clark, <EM>Great American Sculpture</EM>, 1878). Despite this, the piece was first exhibited to great acclaim at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876 and critics raved that it was the most impressive American sculpture in the show. Not long after its debut, however, <EM>Death of Cleopatra</EM> was presumed lost for almost a century—appearing at a Chicago saloon, marking a horse’s grave at a suburban racetrack, and eventually reappearing at a salvage yard in the 1980s. The Museum has an online exhibit that documents the statue’s storied history and conservation."

Still, <i>Evening Rendezvous</i> is a deeply political painting. The abstract dabs of white emerging from a gray twilight are hooded Klansmen, gathered around a bonfire suggested by the hot reds at the center of the image. Angular white shapes evoke the men closest to the headlights of their cars, while at the top of the canvas, others are obscured by blue smoke. The combination of red, white, and blue mocks the patriotism that the Klan claimed in its defense.<p>Most New York art critics in the 1950s and 1960s insisted that painting could be about nothing except painting. Any artist who argued otherwise risked bad press and lost sales. This climate might have led Lewis to proclaim that his art was meant solely to express ""man's creative endeavors."" <i>Evening Rendezvous</i> veered close to the forbidden territory of figural painting, and more importantly, it brought the turmoil of the civil rights movement into the gallery.

This sculpture, completed two years before Ney died, suggests the remorse and guilt the artist felt about her relationship with her estranged son, Lorne. Ney sympathized with Lady Macbeth because they were both strong women who did not submit to the conventions of their times. In act 5, scene 1 of Shakespeare's tragedy the scheming queen is sleepwalking, a tortured soul whose contradictions are represented by the sharp diagonals of her clothes, her deeply furrowed brow, and the strained left arm that reaches across her body. Lady Macbeth dreams that a spot of blood has fallen on her hand, and no matter how many times she washes it, the ""damned spot"" will not come out. Although hardly the conspirator that Lady Macbeth was, Ney related to her subject's internal conflict. As an adolescent, Lorne had stopped speaking to his mother and had moved out of his parents' home. He felt his mother was too controlling and did not understand him because she made him dress in togas and would not let him play with children his own age. She held herself responsible for the loss of her son and expressed her grief through the sculpture of Lady Macbeth.</p>"

The <i>Running Fence</i> existed for only two weeks; it survives today as a memory and through the artworks and documentation by the artists. </p> <p>The collective archive of artworks and research material acquired by SAAM includes more than 350 individual items. With this acquisition, the museum has obtained nearly fifty original preparatory works by Christo, including eleven masterful large-scale drawings&mdash;each eight feet wide&mdash;and thirty-five additional drawings and collages he made in preparation for the final installation. The archive also includes a sixty-eight-foot-long scale model; more than 240 documentary photographs by Wolfgang Volz in color and black-and-white; a film by the critically acclaimed filmmakers David Maysles, Charlotte Zwerin, and Albert Maysles; documents; 324 color slides; original components, including one of the 2,050 nylon fabric panels; a twenty-one-foot steel pole, three and one-half  inches in diameter, with steel cables and guy wires; one of the 13,000 specially designed anchors; and a few of the 350,000 hanging hooks.</p> <p><i>Running Fence, Sonoma and Marin Counties, California, 1972&ndash;76, A Documentation Exhibition</i> is the first major Christo and Jeanne-Claude complete project archive to be acquired by a museum.</p> <p>The <i>Running Fence</i> is considered one of the most important early public art projects, and when it was installed in 1976, it was the most ambitious work undertaken by Christo and Jeanne-Claude since their 1964 arrival in the United States. When it was unveiled during America's bicentennial, it captured the public's imagination. The sheer beauty of the light and weather playing across the fabric of the fence stood in sharp contrast to the underlying issue of division and limitations that fences generally convey. For Christo and Jeanne-Claude, the fence embodied larger issues of human freedom and constraint. The planning, design, installation, and critical response to the <i>Running Fence</i> set the tone for each of their subsequent major public projects. None would have been imaginable without it.  </p> <p>From 1972 when the <i>Running Fence</i> was first conceived until 1976 when it was completed, Christo and Jeanne-Claude faced seemingly insurmountable challenges. In addition to negotiating land rights with fifty-nine ranchers, Christo and Jeanne-Claude grappled with bureaucratic hurdles at a time when the artists had no fame to pave the way. Christo and Jeanne-Claude convinced ordinary Americans of the transformative power of art.<p>New Acquisitions</p>"

Inspired by the ""collaborative challenge"" at the 1999 AAW symposium, thirty-two members of the guild decided to undertake a group project to build a lathe completely from turned wood. Over six months they designed and crafted each individual part, including the motor, chisels, and nuts and bolts, using a total of thirty-one different hardwoods. The lathe is mechanically accurate and demonstrates the combined skill and craftsmanship of all those involved in the project."

Like many of Kathleen Royster Lamb's pieces, leaves and thorns play a prominent role in the interpretation of the design. To Lamb, the leaves signify a protective layer while the thorns symbolize pain. Lamb considers the pear shape to be a feminine form where the leaves protect the fruit's fleshy, delicate core from the thorns of the creamer and sugar bowl. By exposing the core of the fruit, she wants to create a feeling of vulnerability and drama. Lamb intentionally emphasized the length of each pear's stem in an attempt to represent the balance, or lack thereof, that we find within ourselves.

Silver Nitrate, a material that according to Myers ""is a strong flux and runs quite at will on the surface of the piece,"" was applied with a paintbrush during the hot-working process. It fused with the glass in surprising ways, heightening the sense of spontaneity in the work.

Although Bosworth has tracked more than one hundred of these trees across the continent, she is as concerned with capturing the feeling of the surrounding landscape as describing the particular details of each tree. We are shown only the base of the coast redwood's trunk; a figure nearly hidden in the undergrowth offers the only indication of its height, which reaches over three hundred feet above the forest floor. Redwoods and giant sequoias have long been highlights for summer tourists, but the champion western redcedar is perhaps a more telling example of the fate of many of these natural landmarks. It was discovered within a stand of old-growth forest that was being clear-cut, and now remains as a lone sentinel guarding a deserted landscape. While some of these champions are protected within national or state parks and forests, Bosworth has been more frequently drawn to the commonplace locations where the majority are found: backyards, rural crossroads, parking lots, and housing developments.<p><i>Earth and Sky: Photographs by Barbara Bosworth</i> exhibition label"

Bosworth first photographed the tree in 1990 (see <a href=""http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=32263"">1991.69.1</a>), and the museum acquired a print of the image the following year. She returned a decade later to discover the elm had fallen victim to the natural effects of wind and lightning, as well as vandals who had firebombed the trunk, leaving only one large healthy branch remaining.<p><i>Earth and Sky: Photographs by Barbara Bosworth</i> exhibition label"

She begins by exposing two, three, or four eight-by-ten-inch negatives in sequence, and then makes a contact print by setting the negatives side by side on a single sheet of photographic paper. The unexposed border of the film where the negatives meet appears as a black line. Although Bosworth could easily trim this mark away, she chooses not to hide the seam between each frame, preferring the evidence of her technique to remain visible. At a time when digital manipulation is becoming the norm, it is refreshing to encounter images that consciously draw attention to the photographic process and the manner of an image's creation.<p><i>Earth and Sky: Photographs by Barbara Bosworth</i> exhibition label"

As with her champion tree photographs, these images seem at first to be concerned with classifying the natural world in systematic detail. Yet they are also part of an encompassing portrait of a complex and interconnected universe filled with wonder and metaphor. Birds have been long recognized as both literal and figurative messengers. Their regular migrations mark the change in seasons, with bluebirds foretelling the arrival of spring and long vees of geese the coming winter. And they are also swift couriers, arcing across the open sky to carry forward our desires. Bosworth discovered gestures in Renaissance paintings by Fra Angelico and Lorenzo Veneziano that resembled her own images: ""I was amazed by a painting of a saint with his arms extended, releasing a bird towards heaven. It reminded me of the motion made when these captive birds are set free.""

The corporation contracted Mildred Constantine, a curator at the Museum of Modern Art, to consult on art for its new campus, which was completed in 1975. Having recently juried the International Biennial of Tapestry in Lausanne, Switzerland, Constantine convinced AT&amp;T to furnish its offices with contemporary textiles. Hicks's commission, the largest for the complex, consisted of two eight-foot-by-twenty-two-foot tapestries hung on opposite sides of a glass staircase leading to the executive suites. Walking between these rich fiber walls evoked the feeling of entering a rainforest.
<P>Hicks's architectural installations are considered ambitious expressions in post-war American art and contributed to shifting the perception of fiber from simply a domestic pursuit to an artist's medium. She has shown a particular sensitivity to weaving traditions, as well as the interplay of color, texture, and space, demonstrating the influence of her education under renowned colorist Josef Albers, his wife, the prominent weaver Anni Albers, and architect Louis Kahn.

The cramped space of this composition, made even more confined by the two horizontal planks across the window frame, creates a feeling of tension and claustrophobia.</P>
<P>This drawing is charged with ambiguities and possibilities. What are the figures looking at? What is their relationship? Are they both even looking at the same thing? Why is the doll missing parts of her body? Does her truncated body suggest the limited opportunities the little girl will face? Do the two boards across the window simply confine the figures, or do they also represent how the lives of these two figures are barred from full development by restrictions imposed on people of their race?

In this painting, Wiley looked to the work of Hieronymous Bosch (about 1450–1516) to express his dismay at the consequences of the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in the Ukraine. His friend Holbrook Teter visited the town of Grebeny, in Belarus, with a group of health professionals several years after the incident and shared his notes with Wiley. Grebeny was a village located well into the zone contaminated by radiation. People who fled the incident had returned because they had nowhere else to settle. The hopelessness and desolation of deformed animals, of people eating food and breathing air that was poisoning them, was so overwhelming to Wiley that his first attempts to convey the devastation seemed totally inadequate.

Paik's art and ideas embodied a radical new vision that was embraced around the world and changed global visual culture. With this acquisition, the American Art Museum becomes the institution of record for understanding this provocative artist's profound impact on the art world and for understanding the history of the moving image in twentieth-century art.</p>  <p>The Nam June Paik Archive consists of research material, documentation, correspondence, sculptural robots, and video and television technology. It provides unprecedented insight into Paik's creative process, his sources of inspiration, and the communities of artists on three continents with whom he worked for more than five decades beginning in the 1950s. The collective archive includes thousands of individual items that will be catalogued during the next several years. </p>  <p>The Archive includes early writings on art, history, and technology, correspondence with key artists and collaborators such as Charlotte Moorman and John Cage, a complete collection of videotapes used in his work, production notes for videotape and television projects, plans for video installations, documentation of large-scale television projects such as <i>Guadalcanal Requiem</i> (1977/1979) and installations including the massive <i>The More the Better</i> (1988), sketches, notebooks, and models. The archive also includes a full range of technology that Paik worked with, including a variety of early models of televisions and video projectors, old radios, record players, cameras, and musical instruments supplemented by technical manuals. It includes notes and hand-drawn plans for the Paik-Abe video synthesizer&mdash;invented in 1969 with Japanese engineer Shuya Abe&mdash;that transformed electronic moving-image making. Additional materials that provide insight into Paik's career are unpublished interviews, audiotapes, vintage photographs, documentation of early Fluxus performances from before and after Paik's move to New York City in 1964, flyers, announcements, posters, catalogues, and works in progress. A variety of toys, games, folk sculptures, banners, wall hangings, and the desk where he painted in his studio are also part of the Archive.</p>  <p>John G. Hanhardt, consulting senior curator for film and media arts at the Museum since 2006, is leading the effort to organize the Nam June Paik Archive and establish a study center at the Museum. He is the foremost expert in Paik's work, and was the organizing curator for two landmark exhibitions, the first in 1982 at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the second a retrospective presented as the first exhibition of the new millennium in 2000 at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City. Once the archive is fully catalogued, it will be made available by appointment.</p>  <p>The Nam June Paik Archive is a gift of the Paik Estate through executor Ken Hakuta, the artist's nephew and an emeritus member of the Museum's advisory board of commissioners, with the agreement of Shigeko Kubota, the artist's widow.</p>   <p>The Museum has several significant works by Paik on permanent public view in the galleries, including an early work called <i><a href=""http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=76252"">Zen for TV</a></i> (1963/1976), and two ambitious and massive video walls, <i><a href=""http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=71478"">Electronic Superhighway: Continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii</a></i> (1995) and <i><a href=""http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=36486"">Megatron/Matrix</a></i> (1995).<p>New Acquisitions</p>"

These protagonists first appeared in comic books and were further popularized in cinema and television, the media that brought theater to the masses. Some of Newport's other subjects include fictionalized heroes of the American West, such as Rawhide Kid and Two Gun Kid, and characters of his own invention, such as Sweaterman. Knitting is more readily associated with craft than high art, so Newport's lowbrow process, emphasized by his use of acrylic yarn, affirms his message about the influence and pervasiveness of the popular.
<P>A superhero's sleek suit generally functions as a shield from injury, but the only protection that Newport's homey outfits offer is from the cold. They underscore the false security promised by fantastic beings. Far from skintight, the suits droop and sag. When displayed on a hanger they are lifeless, shroudlike vestments that seem to mock the implied physical power of the familiar emblems and color schemes. Though the artist creates them to his own proportions, their misshapenness indicates that they will fit no one well and everyone adequately. This is evident in Newport's prints, which are visual narratives about characters wearing his costumes. The artist sometimes knits in public while wearing one of his knitted suits. He performs in the everyday arena transformed by his dress; the most ordinary locales have the potential to be his stage.</P>

2010.29                                   ,New Acquisition Label,"Kerry James Marshall is one of the leading contemporary painters of his generation. Over the past twenty-five years, he has become internationally known for monumental images of African American history and culture. Marshall attributes his interest in these subjects to the geography of his upbringing. Born in Birmingham, Alabama just as the bus boycotts were beginning, the artist and his family moved to the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, in 1963 (two years before the race riots) and finally settled in South Central Los Angeles at the height of the civil rights movement. The experience of growing up at the epicenter of socio-political change has yielded a body of work deeply rooted in personal biography and historical detail.
<P><I>SOB, SOB</I> evokes Marshall's intellectual journey over the last fifty years beginning with his boyhood visits to the local library. According to the artist, by the third and fourth grades he knew ""every single art book in the library,"" and by the seventh grade he was taking summer classes at the Otis Art Institute. <I>SOB, SOB</I> reflects this thirst for information. It is a painting about the accumulation and dissemination of knowledge, and relates closely to Marshall’s ongoing exploration of African American history.</P>
<P>The painting depicts a female figure seated in front of a tall shelf of African history books. A volume titled <I>Africa since 1413</I> lies at her feet as she gazes into the sunlit interior. It’s unclear whether her contemplative gaze is one of wistful longing for a pre-colonial past or anguish over the transformation of the African continent that began in 1413 with European expeditionary missions. A thought bubble floating above the girl's head further complicates this emotional ambiguity. The text can be read as either a cry of despair or a pointed expression of anger.</P>
<P>Painted in 2003, <I>SOB, SOB</I> marks a pivotal moment in Marshall's career as one of the first paintings to address the idea of black aesthetics. The term ""black aesthetics"" first emerged in the early 1960s as a means of promoting racial equality and fostering black cultural pride. Writers, musicians, and visual artists of the period imbued their work with the tones and textures of African American heritage to create a unique form of expression. Marshall's own exploration of black aesthetics grows out of previous paintings like <I>The Garden Project</I> series (1995), which focused on the failed utopia of urban renewal through federal housing projects. <I>SOB, SOB</I> not only represents a new conceptual direction for Marshall, but also a stylistic shift from the glitter-encrusted <I>Souvenir</I> paintings (1998–2002) that commemorate cultural heroes of the civil rights era. In contrast, <I>SOB, SOB</I> presents a spare interior space very different from these earlier works. Here we see Marshall at his most serious and technically refined, meditating on the events that have shaped the lives of African Americans today. </P>

2010.2A-E                                 ,New Acquisition Label,"Jean Shin has created a diverse body of work using ordinary items accumulated through a lengthy process of social exchange with friends, relatives and various communities. Broken umbrellas, empty wine bottles, old record albums, and used clothing are just a few of the objects that Shin has collected in massive quantities and reconfigured into sculptural installations. In her hands, these humble objects become new again, revealing the potential of things we seldom give a second glance.
<P>Shin's sculptures and installations are at once rigorously formal and emotionally resonant, mass-produced yet insistently handmade. They reference a wide range of art historical precedents, from minimalism, with its unyielding repetition of singular forms, to feminism, with its focus on traditional craft techniques, and Arte Povera, with its connection to everyday life.</P>
<P>The body is a central metaphor in Shin's work, born from her study of anatomy, life drawing, and figurative painting. The donated items she gathers from friends, relatives, colleagues, and community members serve as surrogates for their original owners by referencing the body both physically and metaphorically. This relationship is particularly evident in <I>Chemical Balance III.</I></P>
<P><I>Chemical Balance III</I> deals with the production, commodification, and consumption of commercial goods. Thousands of empty prescription pill bottles are stacked into towering arrangements that resemble natural forms such as stalactites. The installation speaks to our culture's overconsumption of prescription drugs and our dependency on these medications to correct or alter our internal chemical balance. The containers were collected from nursing homes, pharmacies, friends and family of the artist. The addition of artificial illumination inside each structure functions as a metaphor for the relief and renewed optimism that comes from restored health after an illness.</P>

Although he had just finished the sixty panels of his epic <I>Migration</I> series, he had only second-hand knowledge of the South, the point of origin for thousands of rural blacks who had made the great migration to industrial cities of the urban north. The South was a new experience for the young New Yorker. Lawrence's mother had come from Virginia, his father from South Carolina, so as he remarked in 1961: ""[In 1941] if you weren't born in the South, your parents were. Your life had a whole Southern flavor; it wasn't an alien experience to you even if you had never been there.""
<P><I>Bar and Grill</I> shows the interior of a café that is divided by a floor-to-ceiling wall that separates the commercial space into two realms—one occupied by whites, the other by blacks. Apart from obvious segregation by race, the image also reveals status. White customers drink in comfort, cooled by a ceiling fan above. The number of figures occupying each side of the room reflected the white-black ratio of city residents.</P>
<P>Living in a southern city where legislation required that he ride in the back of city buses and live in a racially segregated neighborhood, Lawrence discovered the daily reality of Jim Crow segregation. This experience emerged in <I>Bar and Grill</I> and other paintings that dealt with what he called ""the life of Negroes in New Orleans.""</P>

The show was a huge success for Lawrence, who was celebrated by black and white critics alike. Halpert continued to push Lawrence's work, and two years later, when Lawrence was drafted to serve as a steward in the Coast Guard, she persuaded his commanding officers to provide studio space so he could continue to paint.</P>

To appeal to the president's unpretentious taste, Saint-Gaudens designed a simple obverse featuring Roosevelt's profile and the Latin phrase <i>Aequum cuique,</i> a translation of his campaign slogan, ""A square deal for every man."" The reverse features a proud eagle, the sculptor's favorite coin motif, and an inscription indicating the place and date of the inauguration.

As such, <I>US Highway 1</I> is a seminal work in D'Arcangelo's oeuvre and a prime example of his signature compositional format: a long strip of asphalt cutting through the landscape and plunging toward a vanishing point on the distant horizon. Dark green silhouettes of trees flank the two-lane highway. The sky above is a solid plane of dark blue. The space is both flat and penetrating. Signs along the highway appear to float over the road as if time has been suspended. This surreal, almost dreamlike quality indicates a major difference between D'Arcangelo's conception of the highway and road imagery presented to the American public by writers such as Jack Kerouac and photographers like <A href=""http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=8565"">Robert Frank</A>. The latter see the road as a place where things happen, where rites of passage occur and stories unfold. For D'Arcangelo, the road is a place without time and without characters—just the hypnotic repetition of road signs and billboards and the forward motion of the car.

2011.16                                   ,New Acquisition Label,"Over the last ten years, Mickalene Thomas has become known for large-scale paintings of American women provocatively posed against boldly patterned backgrounds adorned with rhinestones. Her work explores notions of beauty, sexuality and black female identity. Thomas's use of rhinestones and vivid textile patterns adds an even greater sense of drama and sensuality to her paintings. She is one of many contemporary artists experimenting with non-traditional materials, particularly glitter and sequins. For Thomas, the rhinestones evoke folk art traditions and Haitian voodoo art. They also serve as a metaphor for female beauty products, which can both enhance and mask a woman's identity.
<P>Thomas's work stems from her study of art history and the classical genres of portraiture, landscape, and still life, and is inspired by a wide range of sources, from Hudson River School landscapes to Henri Matisse’s nudes and Romare Bearden's collages. Although her paintings often reference the familiar compositional arrangements of odalisque paintings, Thomas imbues her subjects with an agency and action seldom seen in the canon of figurative painting. <I>Portrait of Mnonja</I> is a stunning example of Thomas's recent work. The reclining figure is posed in a sassy contrapposto and situated against a wood-paneled background redolent of a seventies-era living room. She wears a loose-fitting white blouse with a plunging neckline, and her hair is pulled back in a low bun. Her right hand rests on her knee, revealing nail polish that matches her audacious pink heels. She exudes dignity and self-assurance.</P>

2011.32                                   ,New Acquisition Label,"Matthias Pliessnig's extraordinary amorphous furniture has its unlikely roots in the history of wooden boat-building. While studying at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Pliessnig, fellow student Benjamin Wooten, and professor Tom Loeser embarked on a project to each build a simple skiff for use on the town's surrounding lakes. Muddling through the basics of marine design required learning to steam-bend wood, an ancient technique that effectively boils the resin inside wood, rendering the stock malleable. Use of steam-bending is evident in the shape of boat hulls across the globe but has only influenced furniture design sporadically, including the eighteenth-century development of the Windsor chair and the nineteenth-century catalogue of the Austrian firm Gebrüder Thonet.
<P>Pliessnig's epiphany was the realization that a boat's skeleton—the ""stations"" running from port to starboard, and ""stringers"" running from bow to stern—could be adapted for seating by flipping the form upside down and contouring it to the body. His experimentation with this design process since 2006 has produced a rapidly evolving series of furniture, each piece more technically ambitious than the last. <I>Drift</I> is the most recent work in this series.</P>
<P>The steam-bending process is unusual enough in contemporary furniture to merit further description. Strips of wood are first air-dried, then soaked in water for several hours before being placed in a steam box. Wood is both saturated with water and heated, rendering the resin inside pliable and the wood extremely malleable. When the wood is removed it must be bent into position and clamped into place within thirty seconds, after which it will cool, regaining rigidity. During this finite window the wood fibers will slip around each other to meet the stock's new form, allowing the wood to maintain its original strength (as opposed to sawn wood, in which the fibers are cut and weakened). After remaining clamped in position for six to eight hours the wood will maintain its new shape permanently.</P>
<P>The pace of this work necessitated by this process is frenetic, but it is not improvisational. Pliessnig designs his pieces using Rhinoceros 3-D software before attempting to recreate the designs in wood. Because the program cannot account for the limitations of organic materials, the transition from screen to object can be enormously challenging. Pliessnig has stated that <I>Drift</I> includes his most difficult bends to date. This also is only the third piece to include pegged joints, the others being <I>Rivulet</I> (with bamboo) and <I>Amada</I> (with birch), both in private collections. Although the pegs appear to offer structural reinforcement, the sheer number of points of contact in Pliessnig's work (approximately 7000 in <I>Drift</I>) makes it incredibly strong, and the pegs serve more as a labor-intensive embellishment.</P>

2011.36A-D                                ,New Acquisition Label,"Alexis Rockman (b. 1962) has been depicting the natural world for more than two decades. Rockman spent his childhood exploring the halls of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, where he developed an early passion for the natural sciences. He began painting at the age of twenty-one and quickly established himself in the New York art scene with eerily seductive paintings of organic processes and teeming life-forms. Since then, Rockman has gained international acclaim for his unique synthesis of art and science. Each meticulously rendered painting is an amalgam of historical research, scientific observation and unbridled imagination. Rockman's sources include botanical illustrations, habitat dioramas, nineteenth-century landscape painting, sci-fi film, and first-hand field study.
<P>In recent years, Rockman has focused more explicitly on environmental issues, combining empirical fact with plausible fiction to proffer an apocalyptic vision of the future. This is nowhere more evident than in his masterpiece, <I>Manifest Destiny.</I> While Rockman has always dealt with the fracture between the nature and culture, <I>Manifest Destiny</I> is his first work to confront the climate crisis. The painting comprises four contiguous panels extending twenty-four feet in length, and depicts the Brooklyn waterfront several hundred years in the future. The composition is framed by the ruins of two bridges. On the far left panel a futuristic suspension bridge lies beneath the elevated waters of the East River, where the Manhattan Bridge once stood. The historic Brooklyn Bridge stands in ruinous decay on the far right panel of Rockman's painting, a victim of its own aging infrastructure. But the end of modern civilization does not mark the end of all life. On the contrary, <I>Manifest Destiny</I> is teeming with organic growth. Rockman uses the image of urban decay to demonstrate the adaptive powers of nature. The presence of local flora and fauna confirms that life, in many forms, will persist even if humanity does not.</P>
<P>This is a seminal painting by Rockman. In addition to being a technical tour-de-force, it represents four years of intensive research and collaboration with engineers, architects, and climatologists. It is a painting steeped in art historical reference, but profoundly forward-looking. The Smithsonian American Art Museum offers an ideal context for such a multivalent work. Not only does it connect to works, like Walton Ford's <I><A href=""http://www.americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=76772"">Tur</A>,</I> but it also relates to the museum's collection of nineteenth-century landscape painting. And the Smithsonian-wide emphasis on natural science and biodiversity affords a still richer framework for understanding this work.</P>

2011.8                                    ,New Acquisition Label,"The Smithsonian American Art Museum's distinguished collection of works by Albert Pinkham Ryder, who has long been considered one of America's greatest romantic painters, is one of the strengths of the museum's extensive Gilded Age material. Together, these works illuminate one of the rare talents of American art. Separately, they provide enchanting glimpses into Ryder's world of literary figures and poetic metaphors.
<P><I>The Lorelei,</I> one of the painter's larger canvases, is the only painting by Ryder that links love and death in a way so intriguing to late nineteenth-century artists, poets, and musicians. Ryder based his work on Heinrick Heine's famous poem in which Lorelei was an evil seductress, similar to the Greek siren. She lived atop a high rock along the treacherous narrows of the Rhine River. With her irresistible song, she enchanted passing sailors, who strove to reach her. Here a sailor tries to steer his craft toward the nymph on the rock but is sucked to his death in whirlpools and rapids, as are all others. Heine's <I>The Lorelei</I> was translated and widely published in America and put to music by numerous composers. Ryder quite possibly was familiar with Friedrich Silcher's popular melody of the verse, for friends often heard him ""sing the song of the Lorelei"" while working on the painting during his night sessions.</P>
<P>Ryder was obsessed with this dark and brooding scene, which he worked over more than any of his other paintings. The tragic scene and his inability to let it go may in fact symbolize Ryder's realization that he was never to find a woman to love. From the mid-1890s until his death in 1917, he strove for the perfection of his inner vision, even though he pronounced the painting ""finished"" in 1896. Visitor after visitor remarked on the constantly changing position of Lorelei within the painting.</P>
<P><I>The Lorelei</I> originally was intended for Helen Ladd Corbett, daughter of Portland, Oregon, banker William Ladd and a close friend of Charles Erskine Scott Wood, one of Ryder's major patrons who acted as intermediary. Mrs. Corbett even paid for it, but never received the painting. For unknown reasons the painting went to Wood after the artist's death and remained in the Wood family until 1957. Alastair Martin purchased <I>The Lorelei</I> in 1959, and his son, Robin Martin, gave the painting to the museum in 2011. In 2005, Alastair Martin presented the museum with Ryder's early, small painting <I><A href=""http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=74942"">The Lovers' Boat</A>,</I> depicting two blissful lovers in romantic moonlit and suggesting the painter’s optimism towards finding love. Thus, Ryder comes full circle in these two paintings. </P>

The tale of the Lorelei became popular in the mid-nineteenth century when German poet Heinrich Heine (1797-1856) penned a poem about her, which a number of composers set to music. Ryder's image is based on the second and third stanzas of the poem (above), and his friends reported that he sang ""the song of the Lorelei"" while working on this painting.

According to German folklore, the Lorelei is an evil seductress who lives on a large rock above the Rhine River. Much like the sirens of Greek mythology, she beguiles sailors with her singing, luring their ships to destruction. There actually exists such a rock, marking the river's narrowest point between the North Sea and Sweden. The strong current and submerged rocks make this area dangerous to navigate and it has been the scene of many shipwrecks throughout history. Ryder worked on <i>The Lorelei</i> for many years. He wrote in 1896 that he'd finished the painting, but continued to rework the canvas until his death, more than twenty years later. Ryder struggled with where to place the ""witching maiden,"" and over the years his glazes faded, causing the figure to blend into the rocks behind her.
